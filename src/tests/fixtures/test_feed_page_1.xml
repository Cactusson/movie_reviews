					<description><![CDATA[It doesn’t always work, but Charli xcx, as ever, throws a wild party.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the summer of 2024, it seemed impossible to escape the neon slime color and lowercase text of Charli xcx’s sixth studio album, <em>Brat</em>. For a movie about the feel-good party season that never seemed to end, Charli and director Aidan Zamiri have taken a rather different approach than the traditional concert film featuring behind-the-scenes snippets of tour life and rehearsals leading up to a big show in front of waves of screaming fans. “The Moment” is something different, a big swing into the mockumentary genre satirizing the pressures of pop stardom and the struggle for creative control. It doesn’t always work, but Charli xcx, as ever, throws a wild party. </p>



<p>Following an exaggerated version of the star herself, Zamiri’s “The Moment” begins with a bang: Charli xcx dancing among strobe lights that change from green-to-blue-to-red complete with a flashing light warning. It’s September 2024, a few months into the newly minted “Brat” era, but the party atmosphere simmers down once Charli catches her breath. Then it’s on to London, then a British <em>Vogue </em>video shoot, terse Zoom calls in the limo, and finally, back to a party for a much-needed stress break. Being famous is a grind. The hurricane around Charli is only growing more destructive as plans for a concert film mess with her creative process and her relationship with her creative director. With the label (headed by <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/rosanna-arquette" data-type="person" data-id="44156">Rosanna Arquette</a>), managers, and now a highly-opinionated and patronizing director (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/alexander-skarsgard" data-type="person" data-id="75338">Alexander Skarsgård</a>) trying to dictate how best to keep Brat Summer going forever, Charli xcx must figure out what <em>Brat</em> means to her and whether or not to keep “the moment” going. </p>



<p>To her credit, Charli xcx throws herself into the role, playing the part of a mercurial pop star who’s trying to be cool in spite of all the outside forces meddling with her vision. She is her own wild card, quickly changing gears and sending her team scrambling to accommodate each new mandate. At times, she can be off-puttingly selfish, but again, this is the satire world version of Charli, likely standing in for similar stars who after pouring their energy into a hit-making album struggle to figure out what’s their next move. “The Moment,” which is based on Charli’s idea and experiences then expanded into a script by co-writers Zamiri and Bertie Brandes, may lack in concert footage but it is full of jokes about the industry, including a pretty clever subplot about a “Brat&#8221;-branded credit card that causes trouble for Charli and a string of never-ending ads and commercials featuring the star hawking everything from skincare to wine. In our current state of celebrity culture, it seems like an inescapable part of the machine, alongside the late-night talk show stops and long hours spent in the make-up chair. A number of cameos also add to the movie’s madcap spirit including Kate Berlant, Kylie Jenner, and Rachel Sennot, who delivers the withering line, “Are you doing the Joaquin Phoenix thing?” Indeed, there is a bit of Casey Affleck&#8217;s “I’m Still Here” in the DNA of “The Moment” as well as “This Is Spinal Tap” with the inclusion of questionable stage props and even a bit of Howard Stern’s “Private Parts,” a fictionalized version of Stern’s fight with the suits with a healthy dose of irreverent humor.</p>



<p>Zamiri, who previously collaborated with Charli xcx on her music videos “360” and “Guess,” joins forces with cinematographer Sean Price Williams to bring a stylish approach to the film, one that after the bombastic opening, doesn’t get too many opportunities to shine. Instead, the film takes on a faux cinema vérité approach, watching the events unfold when both the film crew are and aren’t there. With so much going on, “The Moment” loses its momentum about halfway through, meandering between interpersonal skirmishes a la “The Thick of It” without the quick editing or the zingers. The party spirit never quite recovers its kinetic presence. </p>



<p>Despite its messy second half, it’s amusing to watch Charli skewer her own public persona, celebrity culture, and its corporate packaging, poking fun at money-driven executives and how other creative forces can affect the way we see our favorite performers. “Brat Summer” was a vibe until it wasn’t. “The Moment” is Charli xcx’s kiss off to the end of an era, a parting gift to the last Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A labor of love by the Adams Family, a filmmaking collective, quite generous with its gore. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Mother of Flies,&#8221; about a father and daughter who get tangled up with a faith healer in a remote woodland area, is a family movie, but not in the way the phrase is usually used. It&#8217;s a nightmare parable about mortality, grief, faith, and the fragility of the flesh, made by one of the most fascinating filmmaking teams in American cinema, the Adams-Poser family.</p>



<p>The operation consists of four people: the father, John Adams, and the Mother, Toby Poser, both actors, and their daughters, Lulu and Zelda Adams. They direct, write, edit, and shoot as a team while they&#8217;re performing on camera. I have only seen a couple of their many films, &#8220;The Deeper You Dig&#8221; and &#8220;Hellbender.&#8221; Both struck me more or less as this one did: not quite my jam, for reasons that might not matter to other people, but clearly the product of talented people who&#8217;ve formed a hive-mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mother of Flies&#8221; has an opening credits sequence that&#8217;s both sensual and vile. That you can&#8217;t quite tell what&#8217;s going on makes it more effective. There&#8217;s blood, viscera, mud, slime, perhaps some other recognizable fluids. The ground is gnarled and irregular, suggestive of the roots of an ancient, old tree and a pile of corpses in a war zone. A naked person&#8217;s gore-slathered back is seen from above, raising and lowering itself, or thrusting at something beneath it. Tightly framed shots of a woman moaning and writhing evoke sexual ecstasy, the final stretch of labor before childbirth, and a body reacting to either the first hit of a powerful narcotic or an agonizing withdrawal from it. Aficionados of oil paintings from earlier centuries may be reminded of Hieronymus Bosch, Francisco Goya, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/19/jusepe-de-ribera-art-of-violence-master-of-gore-dulwich" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jusepe de Rivera</a>, and other artists know for their depictions of Hell. </p>



<p>You won&#8217;t understand the point of those images until you&#8217;re deep into the story, which is about a young woman named Mickey (Zelda Adams) who travels with her father, Jake (John Adams), to a remote woodland house to meet a healer named Solvieg (Tony Poser). Solvieg is plainly defined for the audience as some kind of mystic — a witch or sorceress — before the father and daughter have even met her. The duo hopes that Solvieg can heal Mickey, a terminal cancer patient who has exhausted all the treatment options offered by modern medicine. </p>



<p>Solvieg speaks in everything but straightforward sentences. She monologues and recites scripture or incantations. Often she&#8217;ll launch into what sounds like a parody (intentional or non-) of the &#8220;greatest hits&#8221; of 19th-century English poetry featured in textbooks. Sometimes you can barely understand what she&#8217;s saying or why she&#8217;s saying it that way. Yoda would ask her to bring it down a notch. </p>



<p>But she&#8217;s confident in her powers and demands that the father and daughter submit completely to her process, which is pre-technological. Their diet consists of mushrooms and leaves. There are no bathrooms in the house, so they have to take care of business as their forager ancestors did. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re seeing an account of life in a cult with one leader and just two members.</p>



<p>The movie serves up striking visuals. Solvieg&#8217;s house is covered by thick layers of vines. There&#8217;s so much vegetation encrusting the property that it&#8217;s impossible to tell where the vines end and the house begins. Solvieg is incapable of a non-dramatic entrance. She&#8217;s often silhouetted or glimpsed in half-light, framed by doorways or tree trunks. Mickey immediately begins experiencing visions—maybe hallucinations, maybe supernatural events; we can&#8217;t be sure at first. Lying in bed, she looks up at the ceiling and sees a pulpy, fleshy thing manifest itself and open up. It&#8217;s an orifice, but you can&#8217;t decide what kind because it keeps evolving.</p>



<p>And yes, as the title suggests, there are flies. Lots and lots of flies. If you tried to make a definitive list of movies with swarms of flies in them, you&#8217;d need to include this movie, which is up there with &#8220;Exorcist II: The Heretic&#8221; and the original &#8220;The Amityville Horror.&#8221; As the movie goes on, there are more sequences of intense violence, including one reminiscent of the over-the-top stories that circulated during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1980s and &#8217;90s hysteria over day care centers</a> in the United States: ritual abuse, disfigurement, and torture, babies hacked out of their mothers&#8217; bellies.</p>



<p>There isn&#8217;t a shot that isn&#8217;t meticulously created, lovingly fussed over, and suitable for framing. In an era of often slovenly filmmaking in which the camera is treated mainly as a device to record actors saying dialogue, this is welcome. But there are times when the images are lingered on too lovingly, and you may start to feel as if the component parts of the movie are preventing it from holistic excellence.</p>



<p>There are pacing and rhythm problems too, I think. It&#8217;s not that the movie is slow-paced, with a lot of lead-up to important moments and some sequences of abstractly framed shots that are more artful than useful; it&#8217;s that the slowness lives awkwardly in that zone between &#8220;too slow&#8221; and &#8220;not slow enough,&#8221; and it makes the totality feel disjointed. Lots of horror films are objectively slower than &#8220;Mother of Flies&#8221; but still mesmerize from start to finish. This one is fascinating and often horrifically gorgeous, but not hypnotic. It&#8217;s like a book of horrifying artwork that you can close at any time and return to later, rather than a nightmare that won&#8217;t let you wake up.</p>



<p>But there are so many compensations that it&#8217;s very much worth seeing for anyone who loves horror—especially the atmospheric and gory, dread-based type, rather than the kind that is single-mindedly obsessed with staging jump-scares. The central performances are all special. They&#8217;re not studied. They feel natural, even though every other aspect of the film is unreal and uncanny. And the woods are lovely, dark and deep.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Gans' sequel delivers more of the same, so it likely won’t impress anyone who doesn’t already enjoy getting lost in the fog.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Should you rewatch “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/speaking-out-on-silent-hill" data-type="post" data-id="6223">Silent Hill</a>,” the exceptionally good live-action 2006 video game adaptation, before checking out “Return to Silent Hill,” a narratively unrelated sequel based on the popular “Silent Hill 2” game? Yes and no, though for the same reason: the first “Silent Hill” movie, a creepy and atmospheric mood piece directed by the still largely unsung journeyman <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/christophe-gans" data-type="person" data-id="63860">Christophe Gans</a> (“<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-brotherhood-of-the-wolf-2002" data-type="review" data-id="47089">Brotherhood of the Wolf</a>”), holds up really well. </p>



<p>The 2006 “Silent Hill” gives viewers a clear sense of its source material’s appeal. We trail after Rose (Radha Mitchell), a troubled mother, as she searches for her sick adopted daughter in the titular ghost town. “Return to Silent Hill,” also directed by Gans, delivers a lot of the same moody pleasures as that earlier movie, only its story, about James (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jeremy-irvine" data-type="person" data-id="75876">Jeremy Irvine</a>), a disturbed painter, and his quest to find his wife Mary (Hannah Emily Anderson), often feels simultaneously too light and familiar to match Gans’s previous tribute to Konami’s potently surreal video game series. </p>



<p>Both of Gans’s movies rely on nightmare logic and attendant disorientation to establish their unnerving ambience. You certainly don’t watch these movies for their dialogue, unless you have a very specific taste for emotionally flat, sometimes laughably florid exposition (this is a judgment-free space).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather, you’re more likely to want to see “Return to Silent Hill” for the sake of watching James explore the town’s abandoned streets and various decaying environs. After that, there’s the mystery of what happened to Mary, the daughter of the town’s beloved founder and religious leader Joshua.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, as fans of the video games know, most of the secondary characters mainly reflect back on James as they each provide him with a few morsels of information about Silent Hill and its doomed residents. Video game players are likely used to these background fixtures, which aren’t developed much and are often dismissed as Non-Playable Characters (NPCs). Video game players will also likely be unfazed by the movie’s early scenes, which resemble the games’ non-playable, pseudo-cinematic cut scenes, which provide a lot of wide-angle, god’s-eye views of the town in between scene changes.</p>



<p>James’s story doesn’t crossover with the previous “Silent Hill” movie, but it does feature a number of allusions to its predecessor and its series-defining highlights. Cockroaches with teeth, religious zealots with a purity fetish, and a brolic mute swordsman named Pyramidhead all return to give what sometimes feels like overglorified fan service to presold devotees. But while “Return to Silent Hill” does feel like a faithful and likely necessarily stripped-down approximation of “Silent Hill 2”’s charms, it ultimately pales in comparison to Gans’s previous movie.</p>



<p>Still, it’s hard to knock a sequel too much for landing exactly where its creators seem to have aimed for, especially when most of its shared references still have their background-Jumbotron-video-at-OzzFest-charms. Gans still does a fine job of focusing more on James’s surroundings than on him, which suggests that he understands this assignment more than most.</p>



<p>You don’t need to care about how James will resolve his concerns for Mary, her oversexed doppelgänger Maria (also Anderson), and his mysterious connection to Pyramidhead. “Return to Silent Hill” still mostly succeeds at encouraging viewers to slow down and gawk with James at various putrid creatures and their labyrinthine haunts.</p>



<p>Then again, you might catch a bad case of deja vu if you’ve seen the 2006 “Silent Hill” movie and remember what became of Rose and her encounters with Pyramidhead, the cockroaches, and a different batch of religious zealots. There’s even an eerily similar scare scene in “Return to Silent Hill” featuring another hospital corridor full of faceless, mobility-and-sight-challenged ghost nurses wielding unnecessarily keen scalpels. Would it be a “Silent Hill” movie without them? Probably not. Do these points of contact still feel like an unnecessary nudge in the ribs for fans and maybe a vain attempt at playing the hits for the uninitiated? Yeah, unfortunately.</p>



<p>The worst thing you can say about “Return to Silent Hill” is that it’s not as fresh or compelling as its predecessor, a pitfall that will likely not surprise anybody who has hoped or even waited twenty years for Gans to make another video game movie. Still, you might want to watch Gans’s first “Silent Hill” even if you have no plans to see his follow-up, mostly because it’s a rare video game movie that has no problem treating its characters and their personalities as the secondary draws that they clearly always were. Gans&#8217; sequel delivers more of the same, so it likely won’t impress anyone who doesn’t already enjoy getting lost in the fog.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The hair-raising narrative content notwithstanding, the movie doesn’t create much emotional traction. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Have you ever been in a bind where you needed two signatures on a document to get by, and you were the only person in the room? If so, then you may have firsthand experience that forgery, or attempted forgery, can be something of a lark, something of a game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, of course, it became a game with consequences. In “The Big Fake,” a new fiction film directed by <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/stefano-lodovichi" data-type="person" data-id="266305">Stefano Lodovichi</a> from a script by Lorenzo Bagnotori and Sandro Petraglia, an aspiring artist named Toni, who has generous flowing black hair and beard and piercing blue eyes (he’s played by Pietro Castellitto), discovers that he can duplicate a Modigliani painting perfectly, right down to the signature. It soon follows that there’s money in it. There’s also money to be made forging signatures on large checks. </p>



<p>This is amusing to Toni, who also just enjoys hanging out with the criminal element for fun. He acquires a lovely, affectionate girlfriend who gets almost as much of a kick out of Toni’s particular talent as he initially does. The movie begins when Toni is innocent, hanging out with his provincial best friends, “a priest and a worker,” as he calls them, in a pastoral setting. They then embark to Rome to seek their fortunes, unable to even conceive of the catastrophes that await them. (The soundtrack accompanies them with Iggy Pop’s “The Passenger,” one of several admittedly first-rate needle drops served up by the film.)</p>



<p>Some of these catastrophes are historical and political in nature. The kidnapping of the Italian politician Aldo Moro becomes central to Toni’s story. He’s contacted by representatives of a faction that’s pushing misinformation. They ask him to forge some propaganda from the Red Brigade, the organization claiming to be behind Moro’s abduction. Are you Red or Black, Toni is asked. “I don’t give a f**k about colors. I’m for whoever helps me live well.“</p>



<p>That attitude is his design for living, and it never occurs to him just how much he is playing with fire in this situation. Early in the movie, Toni’s priest friend, Vittorio, utters the Latin phrase “Tertium non datur,” meaning there’s no third option. Certain circumstances are just one way or another. Life, or death, for instance. The stakes are higher by the end of the movie, when Toni’s girlfriend Donata (Aurora Giovinazzo) is pregnant with the couple’s child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hair-raising narrative content notwithstanding, the movie doesn’t create much emotional traction. Not because Toni is difficult to like, although he certainly is. It’s more that it’s difficult to feel <em>anything </em>about him, even after he completes an ingenious heist that he intends as a kind of conceptual art piece.  He sells out almost everyone around him, but he’s also such a, well, worm that you start to believe that it’s their bad judgment that got them in bed with him (so to speak) in the first place. And so, once you’ve completed your cinematic acquaintance with Toni, you only want to shrug the guy off. Maybe even take a shower or something. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The film’s strengths lie squarely with Foy, whose performance is restrained where it should be and revelatory at some moments you don't expect. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the wake of her father’s sudden death in 2007, the English academic Helen Macdonald turned to training a goshawk, attempting to stave off depression by subsuming her grief in a relationship with a bird of prey—not just any bird but one considered notoriously difficult to train, even for trained falconers. But the goshawk’s fierce, unpredictable nature spoke to something wild in Macdonald’s own temperament, to her impulsive and perhaps self-destructive desire to withdraw from civilization, taking solace in the natural world and its primordial ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The hawk was everything I wanted to be: solitary, self-possessed, free from grief, and numb to the hurts of human life,” Macdonald wrote in <em>H Is For Hawk</em>, her prize-winning 2014 memoir about the year she spent rearing this goshawk, whom she named Mabel, even as the rest of her life—from professional obligations to close friendships and basic personal hygiene—fell into disrepair. For all the time and energy Macdonald poured into every last training flight with Mabel, as her memoir made clear in one elegantly agonized passage after another, the mounting intensity of this animal-human connection also signified an obsessive emotional attachment, one that deeper healing—and her inevitable return to society—demanded she shed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the memoir’s alliterative title was read as quaint eccentricity by some of the countless critics who otherwise sang its praises, this could have been because they failed to grasp Macdonald’s meaning: that “H” stood for “hawk” at a time when she couldn’t bear to let it stand, as it always had, for “Helen.” For all its appeal to ornithologists, this was an account of a woman’s most intimate struggle to survive a tragedy that blotted out her sense of self—a story about the way grief perches in the soul.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/claire-foy" data-type="person" data-id="74261">Claire Foy</a> starring in “H Is for Hawk,” there can be no such misinterpretation. The British actress, best known for playing a young Queen Elizabeth on the Netflix series “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/streaming/the-crown-season-five-review-2022" data-type="post" data-id="23144">The Crown</a>,” is heartbreaking in this adaptation’s main role: steely and stoic in the stiff-upper-lip tradition yet thoroughly conscious of her sorrow, which smarts beneath all the poised expressions like the inner wound it is. Foy has always been a fastidious performer, one skilled at surfacing her characters’ emotional states without troubling their carefully controlled exteriors, but there’s a raw fragility to Foy’s work in “H Is For Hawk” that (for as little as she actually cries on screen) honors the strange and unknowable enormity of Helen’s loss. </p>



<p>The scenes where Foy practices falconry, sharing the screen with a feathered co-star, are afforded an idyllic splendor by director <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/philippa-lowthorpe" data-type="person" data-id="142057">Philippa Lowthorpe</a>, who treats the British countryside like a quilted tapestry of open fields and rolling hills, shot through with golden light. But the film is seldom more mesmerizing than during one early sequence, in the cramped darkness of Helen’s apartment, where she struggles to establish an initial bond with Mabel. Concerned that the bird won’t eat, Helen is first perturbed, then panicked, until a friend arrives and provides the distraction necessary for the goshawk to pounce on a meal. Helen grows closer to Mabel as the bird acclimatizes, eventually settling into cohabitation herself. What Foy reveals to the audience in these scenes, Helen’s fight-or-flight responses easing into a quietly watchful posture, is a woman finding a delicate, instinctual peace in wildness. Hers is a performance both civilized and passionate, delivered in such a direct and honest manner that it distills Macdonald’s prose. </p>



<p>If only Lowthorpe’s film (the screenplay for which was co-written with Emma Donoghue, author of <em>Room</em> and its Oscar-nominated adaptation) had as much range in its 115-minute runtime as its lead actress displays in such lovely little moments. Having excised some of the memoir’s less cinematic aspects, like the spiritual kinship that Macdonald came to feel with children’s author T.H. White (whose early-career work <em>The Goshawk </em>also charted a writer’s efforts to tame a bird of prey), their adaptation is straightforwardly focused on dramatizing Helen’s downward spiral, enough so that it ends up saddling Foy with histrionic heavy lifting in the latter half.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Appearing largely in flashback as Helen’s late father, who fostered her love of birding, <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brendan-gleeson" data-type="person" data-id="57210">Brendan Gleeson</a> marshals his craggy features and wry wit toward a performance of soulful immediacy. One not only mourns his character’s passing but also senses his presence lingering over scenes in which Helen unconsciously mirrors her father’s mannerisms, even as she follows in his footsteps. Supporting performances by Lindsey Duncan, as Helen’s mother, and Denise Gough, as her friend, can’t help but bring less to the picture, while later scenes that exist to emphasize Helen’s fraying emotional state—one finds her sleeping in a cardboard box beside Mabel—strike the same wretchedly unhappy note until it mostly just sounds repetitive. </p>



<p>Macdonald’s memoir was deeply interior, and the strain of externalizing it begins to show in overwritten scenes that return Helen from the countryside to Cambridge, where her dynamic with Mabel is derided by unsympathetic onlookers. The film’s strengths lie squarely with Foy, whose performance is restrained where it should be and revelatory at some moments you don&#8217;t expect. For all the majesty Lowthorpe evokes in outdoor sequences that follow hawks swooping and soaring over the woodland, what poet Emily Dickinson referred to as “the thing with feathers” can be glimpsed more fully from the ground. As her weary eyes widen, watching birds in flight, Foy’s features flood first with fear, then wonder, then hope. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The film rarely lets up, but it is interested in character and environment, in mood and emotion, not just plot.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You don’t expect melancholy blue-mood ambiance in a fast-paced thriller, and this gives “In Cold Light” an emotional foundation it might not otherwise have. The film starts with a woman being chased by the cops; she barely stops running for the entire film, yet there’s this deep, quiet intensity underneath it all. Directed by <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/maxime-giroux" data-type="person" data-id="90718">Maxime Giroux</a>, the film rarely lets up, but it is interested in character and environment, in mood and emotion, not just plot.</p>



<p>When we first see Ava (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/maika-monroe" data-type="person" data-id="77902">Maika Monroe</a>), she is jumping through a second-floor window of a drug house to escape the police officers who just busted through the door. She doesn’t seem like a scared newbie. She and her twin brother Tom (Jessie Irving) are dealers, and their drug operation is small and scrappy, but it’s all they seem to have. Ava and Tom are “lost” children. Their mother died when they were young. They take care of each other. Their father Will (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/troy-kotsur" data-type="person" data-id="151050">Troy Kotsur</a>, who won an Oscar for his performance in “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/coda-movie-review-2021" data-type="review" data-id="89364">CODA</a>”) is a battered old bull rider, mean-spirited and intimidating. He keeps his distance from his kids, particularly Ava. Tom has a girlfriend and a new baby (which will come into play later).</p>



<p>Ava is adrift by comparison. She does some jail time for the drug bust and gets a job at the rodeo upon release. When her parole officer asks what she wants out of life, Ava says, “To be free. To be alone.” You believe her. She’s so locked deep within herself. Following a sudden and shocking act of violence, Ava has to go on the run again. She is always just about a foot or two ahead of her pursuers.</p>



<p>Patrick Whistler’s script falls into some cliches but avoids others. What is unspoken is more important than what is said, and the characters who are articulate tend to be up to no good. <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">(<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/helen-hunt" target="_blank">Helen Hunt</a> plays such a character in what could have been a glorified cameo, but, in her hands,</span> is something far more substantial.) Eventually, Ava and her dad have the confrontation that’s been brewing all along, and it takes place entirely outside his house, in sign language (Kotsur, of course, is Deaf). A nice detail is the motion-detecting light turning off at times when there’s no movement between them, and so either Ava or her dad randomly waves their arm in the air, mid-argument, to turn the light back on. The film is full of specifics like this.</p>



<p>Giroux is interested in the rhythm of the whole rodeo world, and he and cinematographer Sara Mishara dig into how it looks and feels, the tunnels leading to offices and locker rooms, the sounds, the people, the tall rodeo lights blurring and dazzling through the blue-black night sky. The location isn’t just background noise. There’s a poetry and a grit to the environment.</p>



<p>Much of the film’s power and gravitas comes from Monroe&#8217;s presence. The stakes of the film are life or death, typical for a thriller, and Monroe’s face, deep with feeling beneath a stoic mask, carries those stakes, propelling the film forward. Monroe has been working in almost stealth fashion for over a decade now. She’s occasionally been cast as “the girlfriend” or “the pretty girl,” but she’s had opportunities to show what she can do in genre films, like the effective “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/it-follows-2015" data-type="review" data-id="67391">It Follows</a>,” or the recent “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/longlegs-film-review-2024" data-type="review" data-id="222766">Longlegs</a>,&#8221; as well as the fantastic (and criminally underseen) “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/watcher-movie-review-2022" data-type="review" data-id="92213">Watcher</a>.&#8221; She’s set free in a genre context and is powerful enough to hold the center of a film. What makes Ava tick in “In Cold Light” is somewhat explained in a couple of flashbacks that show childhood events, but these are unnecessary. Monroe’s face tells us everything we need to know.</p>



<p>A lot of thrillers are exciting but empty. “In Cold Light” is thrilling but very full in unexpected and complicated ways.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“Clika” lacks the electricity and the excitement of watching a performer bring the house down.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many musical biopics are essentially rags-to-riches stories, a parable about how hard work and talent with the right lucky break can make the big time. <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/michael-greene" data-type="person" data-id="49328">Michael Greene</a>’s “Clika” follows in the tried and true footsteps of this still-growing genre but falls far short of becoming a headliner. The movie is a fictitious tale of an artist named Chito (JayDee, the frontman of Herencia de Patrones) who carries around a notebook of song ideas that he adds to in between picking peaches in his hometown of Yuba City, California, and making music with friends. When his family’s home is foreclosed on by the bank, Chito steps up his efforts to make it in the music business and branches out to work with his uncle, trafficking drugs, making the kind of money he never knew possible. </p>



<p>Like Chito, the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/clika-movie-jaydee-singer-herencia-de-patrones-1235500609/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real JayDee</a> scraped together a living picking peaches while pushing the boundaries of his corridos with a rap-influenced flow and a macho swagger to match, channeling old school <em>música mexicana </em>with a new style. The songs themselves are among the film&#8217;s few highlights, as they keep the energy pulsing when JayDee cannot hold the frame. Despite the emotional connection to Greene’s story, producers Sean McBride and Jimmy Humilde, and JayDee’s performance, it&#8217;s stiffer than the shelves in my home. His onscreen presence is a charisma void, draining the life out of every scene he ends with a cast-off &#8220;whatever&#8221; like a 15-year-old who&#8217;s been grounded for the fifth time this week. I hope you like nothing, because that&#8217;s what JayDee is serving here. </p>



<p>Greene and McBride, who previously collaborated on the COVID-era documentary &#8220;Vaccinate Watts,&#8221; are still a pretty green team when it comes to filmmaking. Some of the dialogue is atrocious, some sequences are laughable, and the film is poorly directed. The women in the film are either church-going scolds who don&#8217;t approve of Chito&#8217;s drug dealing, or they&#8217;re background eye candy, girls dancing at a club or in a video, almost completely silent except to cheer on Chito and squeal over his viral video—which, like Chito&#8217;s drug runs, look like the easiest thing he&#8217;ll do all day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a movie that should be about high stakes, all-or-nothing risks, there was almost no heat until the last quarter of the movie, but hey, at least we got to watch a Latina farmworker seductively pouring water over her head to satiate the thirsty boys watching her. Chito&#8217;s love interest is a mere wisp of a character, an aspiring veterinarian who Chito spoils with fancy earrings and a good time, but who prefers to get Chito to church and disappears whenever she’s not an accessory to his story. His mother is similar to the stock character of a tough Latina mom who won’t take dirty drug money even if it means losing the house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, I do give credit to some other members of the supporting cast who try to inject some life (any life) on screen. Eric Roberts outshines his younger counterparts as a kooky kingpin whose wry smile masks a ruthless business acumen. But if Eric Roberts can steal the movie so easily from its star in a bit part that barely adds up to 5 minutes, you know things are not going well.</p>



<p>Unlike previous iterations of music stars struggling to make it to the spotlight, “Clika” lacks the electricity and the excitement of watching a performer bring the house down. “Purple Rain” and “8 Mile” follow their respective idols through arcs loosely inspired by their real-life counterparts, and a classic like “Selena” charts her lifelong journey from singing in restaurants to selling out the Astrodome. This could have landed somewhere in between, but this almost feels like a direct-to-video effort, and worse, it feels like a missed opportunity to celebrate the music and an artist from a community that’s openly being targeted, harassed, and worse. </p>



<p>It’s disappointing because it felt like we could have had something here. When Chito finally takes the stage, not just posing in a closet-turned-recording studio, there is energy and intensity to JayDee’s performance that does not exist anywhere else in the movie. It’s as if that was where he felt the most comfortable, not in front of a camera and crew, but onstage, moving his audience from behind the mic. If only he could have shared a bit more of that persona with the camera, “Clika” might have had a chance.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The videographer for a small school in Russia's Ural Mountains uses his cameras to document the country militarizing after invading Ukraine]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The unfortunately ever-growing archive of films about societies succumbing to war fever gains a memorable new entry with &#8220;Mr. Nobody Against Putin.&#8221; It&#8217;s about the experiences of filmmaker &#8220;Pasha&#8221; Talankin, the videographer and events coordinator for a primary school in Karabash, a petrol refinery town of about 10,000 located in the Ural Mountains. Most of Talankin&#8217;s days are spent recording events at the school. In 2022, Russian Premier Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine, sparking the bloodiest European conflict since World War II. Talankin found himself behind a camera at a time when his school&#8217;s curriculum was being remade by the Russian government, mostly to propagandize young people into docile tools of the state who believe their motherland can do no wrong.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot to recommend this movie, which was shot by Talankin over a two-year timespan, smuggled out of Russia and into Denmark, and put together in Copenhagen by Talankin&#8217;s co-director, David Borenstein. But one of its more quietly revelatory qualities is how it captures the way authoritarianism accelerates in wartime. One day, students, faculty, and administrators are going about their business, and the next, the fax machine in the principal&#8217;s office is spitting out an announcement of the New Federal Education Policy. Time that Talankin used to spend teaching and mentoring is reallocated so he can record endless hours of video of teachers reading state-written materials in classrooms, then upload the footage &#8220;to some mysterious government database.&#8221;</p>



<p>This outrages alarms Talankin, an antiwar progressive who hung a pro-democracy flag in his office and enjoys arguing politics with more right-wing colleagues. As the story unfolds, the war kills students he was close with and shatters their families. Talankin feels increasingly guilty watching TV coverage of protesters barely older than his students getting clubbed and arrested by police. He feels like he&#8217;s doing nothing, and that doing nothing makes him complicit. So he resigns. </p>



<p>But upon reflection, he realizes he made an impulsive, wrong choice. He could have used his position to collect material for a movie documenting a Russian school&#8217;s transformation into one tiny cog in a vast war machine that requires constant demonstrations of loyalty to the state. The de facto military takeover of schools crowds out real education. Almost nobody in Russia actually wanted it or is happy about it. They only participate because if they refuse, they&#8217;ll be marked as enemies of the state. </p>



<p>A movie illuminating this process won&#8217;t stop a war, but it could demolish the motherland&#8217;s claims that the Russian people have unanimously rallied behind it. The challenge for Tamalkin is how to make such a movie without getting beaten, tortured, jailed, or worse. (A 2023 law decreed that any Russian who opposed the Ukraine occupation was guilty of treason, a capital offense.) </p>



<p>Sheer luck must account for a lot of Talankin&#8217;s success, because he doesn&#8217;t try very hard to keep low profile. After an sequence recounting all-hands-on-deck teacher&#8217;s meeting to discuss the school&#8217;s rising rate of students failing classes, there&#8217;s a cut to Talankin and a couple of colleagues decompressing in his office afterward; we hear him off-camera suggesting that &#8220;the reason they are failing is all the bullshit&#8230;&#8217;Go, Russia! Hooray for nuclear weapons!&#8217; is all we have here now.&#8221; Talankin even removes a row of K&#8217;s taped across the panes of a row of picture windows—the Cyrillic letter of the Russian alphabet adopted by pro-war forces, meaning <em>a pobedu</em> (&#8220;for victory&#8221;) or <em>zapad</em> (&#8220;west&#8221;)—and replaces them with X&#8217;s.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s fascinating to watch this man&#8217;s internal struggle become externalized in the filmmaking. It&#8217;s obvious that a lot of his story has been massaged in the editing to create a more &#8220;movie-like&#8221; rhythm and an upbeat feeling, to the point where you may start to imagine a Hollywood remake, probably starring Bill Skarsgard. The score, credited to Michal Rataj and Jonas Struck, runs the gamut from just right to too much. And there are a few moments where the shots of Talankin seeming to react to something that just happened in the story feel posed and inorganic. Talankin, the leading man, is a natural on camera, charming and often heartbreakingly vulnerable, but it&#8217;s clear, even in this inaugural effort, that Talankin the filmmaker needs to keep him on a short leash.</p>



<p>These are minor objections to a major effort, though. Talankin, with Borenstein&#8217;s mighty assist, has made a movie that combines a passionate heart and a generosity of spirit with what, in the United States, we&#8217;d call counterculture humor. Think of the kind showcased in mid-century fiction and cinema, like &#8220;Catch-22&#8221; or &#8220;Apocalypse Now,&#8221; where the only people questioning the mindlessness and corruption of their culture are smart enough to identify what&#8217;s defective but powerless to do anything beyond making hardboiled jokes.</p>



<p>Talankin has a gift for letting ridiculous people look ridiculous with hardly any prompting, as when he asks the school&#8217;s history teacher and official Kremlin representative—a dull man and godawful communicator whose face suggests a gangrenous James Woods—which historical figures he&#8217;d most like to have met. He replies with a list of sadistic madmen and genocide enablers, including Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of police under Josef Stalin, who designed the gulag system. But Talankin gives him the gift of humanization anyway: during a graduation sequence, there&#8217;s a cut to the toady wiping a tear from his eye, proud as any parent.</p>



<p>Purely on a craft level, &#8220;Mr. Nobody Against Putin&#8221; is skillful and engrossing, never more so than when it captures wrenchingly painful moments in people&#8217;s lives with a detachment that keeps the focus on the subjects rather than shifting to Talankin. The strongest is a funeral for a student who was drafted and died in Ukraine. Talankin explains that he didn&#8217;t get video because, with Russia dug deep into the occupation, it might&#8217;ve caused a hostile reaction, so he recorded audio only. Hearing the dead soldier&#8217;s mother wailing inconsolably while staring at a black screen puts the experience in perspective in a way that the most eloquent narration never could.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also fascinating to see the shooting style evolve as Talankin stops being a mere record-keeper and begins using the camera expressively. The shots become more varied and dynamic, the use of streetlamps and sunlight more painterly. The arrangement of faces and bodies within frames becomes more elegant. But there are also times, even in the more emotional later scenes, when the movie lets images speak for themselves. Notice, for instance, how the boys&#8217; haircuts get collectively shorter as the story goes on, and how they start wearing camouflage outerwear, and how the school hallways seem to grow longer and colder. In the movie&#8217;s opening section, Talankin says he knows that if he&#8217;s to rise to the level of the era he&#8217;s chronicling, he&#8217;ll have to stop being a videographer and become a director. And he did.</p>



<p>A side note: Talankin says early in the movie that as his duties expanded, the school hired a second videographer to assist him. This explains all the shots of Talankin operating his own camera, talking to faculty while being observed through a zoom lens, walking up and down stairwells, and so on. The credits list the two main camerapersons as &#8220;Pavel Talankin&#8221; and &#8220;Anonymous.&#8221; As much as I wish I could find out who this person is and write them a fan letter, there are cases where it&#8217;s better not to know, and this is one of them. Anonymous, if you&#8217;re reading this: great work, and stay strong.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Screen-popping and kinetic but ultimately tiresome and borderline dopey.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The “screenlife” technique of telling a story entirely or primarily through desktop and laptop visuals has been put to effective use in films such as “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/unfriended-2015" data-type="review" data-id="67688">Unfriended</a>” (2014), “Host” (2020) and “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/missing-movie-review-2023" data-type="review" data-id="94305">Missing</a>” (2023), as well as in a batch of TV series, e.g., the clever and innovative “Connection Lost” episode of “Modern Family” in 2015. (We also got a spate of mostly forgettable screenlife films and streaming series during the pandemic.)</p>



<p>Full download disclosure: I feel like the gimmick is played out at this point—and by the halfway mark of the screen-popping and kinetic but ultimately tiresome and borderline dopey AI thriller “Mercy,” I found myself yearning for a wireless mouse so I could log off.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/timur-bekmambetov" data-type="person" data-id="69240">Timur Bekmambetov</a> is a screenlife-pioneering producer, and as a director, he has taken some admirable gunslinger swings with the likes of “Night Watch” and “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,” but his latest effort comes across as an uninspired mashup of “The Fugitive” and “Minority Report.” The screenplay by Marco van Belle raises legitimately disturbing questions about our utter lack of privacy in today’s world of social media profile sharing, surveillance cameras, “citizen journalists” wielding smart phones, Gemini, ChatGPT, body cams, etc., etc., but those issues are quickly swept aside in favor of drone-fueled chase sequences and plot reveals we can see coming three scenes in advance. (The script drops breadcrumbs with all the subtlety of a Spring Breaker letting a giant water balloon plummet from a hotel balcony.)</p>



<p>“Mercy” is set in the obligatory dystopian near future—in this case, the crime-ridden Los Angeles of 2029—where lawmakers have recently voted to activate the Mercy Capital Court, a judicial system powered by Artificial Intelligence. <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/chris-pratt" data-type="person" data-id="74439">Chris Pratt</a>’s gung-ho LAPD detective Chris Raven was one of the architects of the system—but now he finds himself the target. Hungover, disoriented, and strapped to a chair at Mercy Capital Court, Chris is charged with the brutal stabbing murder of his wife, Nicole (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/annabelle-wallis" data-type="person" data-id="87010">Annabelle Wallis</a>), in the kitchen of their home. On an oversized screen opposite him is Judge Maddox (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/rebecca-ferguson" data-type="person" data-id="85118">Rebecca Ferguson</a>), an AI program who walks Chris through the rules, which he of course already knows, so the rules are really for our edification:</p>



<p>The Mercy Court acts as judge, jury, and executioner.</p>



<p>Chris will have the city’s “Municipal Cloud” at his disposal, giving him access to every camera, cell phone, and database.</p>



<p>There’s a handy onscreen Guilty Meter that displays the probability that Chris committed the crime, and right now it’s in the high 90s. He has 90 minutes to get that number below 92%, or he will be executed on the spot.</p>



<p>Let the games begin!</p>



<p>The story unfolds in real time, with the clock ticking down from 90 minutes, and that makes for some admittedly effective dramatic tension. Chris is an experienced detective, but his investigation is hampered because he was wasted at a local tavern in the hours just after the crime was committed, got into a nasty barroom brawl, and then blacked out, only to regain consciousness after he was arrested and strapped into that chair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therein lies one of the problems with “Mercy.” Pratt can be a forceful and convincing actor with the right material, most notably the “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2014" data-type="review" data-id="65626">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>” series, but his physicality is a key component of his best performances. For the great majority of time here, Pratt is immobilized, and his emoting isn’t always entirely convincing. You can see him…<em>trying</em>. That same limitation applies to Ferguson, one of the best actors around, who is reduced here to playing what is essentially a talking head—an emotionless program, speaking in a robotic voice. They’re never in the same room together, because Judge Maddox isn’t actually in any room.</p>



<p>That static dynamic between Chris and Judge Maddox is countermanded with an endless barrage of images shot in varying styles. Private cell phone clips, police drone footage, visuals captured by restaurants, street corner cameras, a neighbor’s “bird cam,” you name it. We’re introduced to a handful of key players, including Chris and Nicole’s teenage daughter, Britt (Kylie Rogers, who has to do a lot of on-the-phone crying), his LAPD partner Jaq (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kali-reis" data-type="person" data-id="157065">Kali Reis</a>, stuck with a role that makes little sense), and his AA sponsor Rob, well played by the reliable character actor Chris Sullivan. </p>



<p>We’re fairly late in the story when things take a kind of “Breaking Bad” turn that seems wildly arbitrary—before it becomes almost laughably over the top. The last act of “Mercy” is anything but merciful to the viewer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Brooks is still the man—still willing to do anything for a laugh and still wanting us to love Melvin Brooks]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My few but uproarious <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/11/mel-brooks-memoir-interview?srsltid=AfmBOoqQ54LE22nWwyqi5NIXILKempMXiBOZ1tvWp22_5qh6UdSduFQ3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviews</a> with <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mel-brooks" data-type="person" data-id="37416">Mel Brooks</a> disproved the adage about never meeting your heroes. He was the Mel a fan would want him to be—always “on,” eager to please and promote (and that’s only the p’s), and a fount of great show-business stories.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/judd-apatow" data-type="person" data-id="67789">Judd Apatow</a> and co-director Michael Bonfiglio’s superb two-part documentary “Mel Brooks: The 99-Year-Old Man!” contains definitive versions of several classic Brooks anecdotes, but as with his docs “George Carlin’s American Dream” and “The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling,” Apatow is most interested in learning who the artist really is.</p>



<p>Apatow, a self-professed “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Comedy-Nerd-Lifelong-Obsession-Pictures/dp/0593595939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comedy nerd</a>,” had his work cut out for him with Brooks, who confesses to him that in past interviews, he had been, shall we say, “inaccurate,” or used jokes to create a “public persona of Mel Brooks,” which might be summed up as, in his words, “Your favorite Jew.”</p>



<p>“Do you think people know who you really are?” Apatow asks. “No,” Mel replies.</p>



<p>After almost four hours, they will at least have a better sense of him. Apatow etches an indelible portrait that reveals what makes Mel Brooks run. A recurring theme throughout is Brooks’ anything for a laugh ethos and craving for an audience’s approval. In the opening clip, Brooks recreates the telling song that served to introduce himself to Catskills resort audiences when he was just starting out following his service in World War II:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Here I am, I’m Melvin Brooks<br>I’ve come to stop the show.<br>I’m just a ham who’s minus looks<br>But in your heart I’ll grow…<br>Out of my mind,<br>Won’t you be kind?<br>And please love Melvin Brooks.”</em></p>



<p>Notes Larry Gelbart, with Brooks one of the legendary dream team of writers on “Your Show of Shows,” “[When he was born] Mel thought that when he got slapped in the ass that it was applause and he has not stopped performing since.” Brooks himself tells Apatow that, as a teenager, he became a drummer (taught by the Brooklynite contemporary Buddy Rich) because it was a way to draw attention to himself.</p>



<p>The archival interviews, film clips, and performance footage are deftly curated (although completists may miss acknowledgement of Ernest Pintoff’s 1963 Oscar-winning short “The Critic” and the short-lived TV series, “When Things Were Rotten”). But what will linger are the more reflective moments from Brooks, his children, friends, and a distinguished group of comedians, screenwriters, and directors who reflect on his legacy of how Brooks used the silliest and most scatological humor to shine a light on the darkest of subjects, such as fascism, racism, and antisemitism. “Comedy helps minimize terrible things,” offers Dave Chappelle, who in his late teens made his feature film debut in Brooks’ “Robin Hood: Men in Tights.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part one—premiering Jan. 22 on HBO, with part two following the next night—is more conventionally entertaining as it traces Brooks’ inauspicious origin story, a quintessentially American rags-to-EGOT saga. Raised during the Depression, Brooks lost his father to tuberculosis when he was only two. He and his three brothers were raised by their good-natured, yet tough mother. She “filled me with music and raised our spirits,” Brooks recalls, but he feared his future was to toil on Seventh Avenue—the garment district.</p>



<p>The movies, he said, were “a great escape.” His north star clowns were Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers, and the now-obscure Ritz Brothers. Seeing the Broadway musical “Anything Goes” starring Ethel Merman was a transformative experience that further fueled his desire for a career in entertainment.</p>



<p>Part one deals with early setbacks (including writing for Jerry Lewis, the poor initial response to “The Producers<em>,” </em>the outright flop of his second film, “The Twelve Chairs”), and his first triumphs, from “Your Show of Shows” and “The 2,000 Year-Old Man” comedy routine co-created with Carl Reiner, to TV’s Emmy-winning series “Get Smart” and “Blazing Saddles.”</p>



<p>There are more career benchmarks in Part two—“Young Frankenstein,” the establishment of BrooksFilms, which gave early career boosts to David Lynch and David Cronenberg, “The Producers’” record-breaking success on Broadway—but here Apatow delves further into the defining relationships that shaped Brooks’ life, his friendship with Carl Reiner, and his marriage to Bancroft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seeing the late Rob Reiner talk about his father and Mel’s dynamic is lump-in-the-throat stuff.&nbsp; Though Carl was younger than Brooks, he was embraced as something of a father figure, Rob says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jerry Seinfeld observes of the improvisational back-and-forth that shaped “The 2,000-Year-Old Man,” “A third universe is created just because they’re together and they’re so happy to be together.”</p>



<p>That the not-conventionally handsome Catskills <em>tummler</em> could woo and win the stunning Bancroft, “opened the door for all of us,” Adam Sandler jokes, and pointing at Apatow, husband of actress Leslie Mann, adds, “especially you.”</p>



<p>Bancroft’s and Reiner’s deaths devastated Brooks. Nathan Lane shares that Brooks told him, “If you see me, don’t cry and don’t tell me how bad you feel because I have enough fuckin’ tears of my own.” Rob Reiner says that after his father died, Brooks came to his house every night for months because he wanted to remain close to Carl somehow.</p>



<p>By the end of “The 99-Year-Old Man!”, Brooks is no longer deflecting with jokes. When Apatow asks how he deals with the monumental losses in his life, Brooks responds, “There is no answer to that.”</p>



<p>Recent years have seen something of a Mel-aissance, with the limited series “History of the World—Part Two” and the announcement of a sequel to “Spaceballs.” Rob Reiner recalls that when he was a child, he would get excited about an impending visit from Mel Brooks to the house. “Are you the man?” he would ask Brooks.</p>



<p>As “The 99-Year-Old Man!” makes clear, Brooks is still the man—still willing to do anything for a laugh and still wanting us to love Melvin Brooks.</p>



<p>By the way, if you have not seen “The Twelve Chairs,” by all means seek it out. <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-twelve-chairs-1970" data-type="review" data-id="34561">Roger Ebert gave it four stars</a> and called it “more fully realized” than “The Producers.”</p>
