					<description><![CDATA[Life isn't sugarcoated here, only drenched in blood.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Writer-director <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ryan-prows" data-type="person" data-id="120131">Ryan Prows</a>&#8216; &#8220;Night Patrol,&#8221; a cop corruption thriller that&#8217;s also a vampire movie, has a sprawling cast, but focuses on four characters. There&#8217;s Ethan Hawkins (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/justin-long" data-type="person" data-id="66255">Justin Long</a>), the son of a legendary LAPD cop (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dermot-mulroney" data-type="person" data-id="52331">Dermot Mulroney</a>), who wants to join The Night Patrol, an unofficial, secretive, elite unit within the department that&#8217;s essentially a vampire street gang with badges and uniforms. Ethan&#8217;s partner, Xavier Carr (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jermaine-fowler" data-type="person" data-id="122162">Jermaine Fowler</a>), is a Black patrolman who used to be a member of the Crips gang and hopes to rise through the ranks of the police and become somebody who gives orders as well as takes them. Xavier&#8217;s brother, Wazi Carr (RJ Cyler), is a Crips-affiliated petty criminal who sleeps on a bare mattress at his mama&#8217;s house. He&#8217;s in shock over secretly witnessing an LAPD officer murdering someone close to him, and fears a Night Patrol member will kill him to prevent him from testifying about what he saw.</p>



<p>Finally, there&#8217;s Xavier and Wazi&#8217;s mama, Ayanda Carr (Nicki Micheaux), the former wife of a long-dead revolutionary who has kept a rebellious flame burning in her heart for decades. Ayada is also a mystic, a local historian of sorts, and an aficionado of supernatural lore. She&#8217;s plugged into a network of anti-authoritarians (some criminals, some not) that find and kill monsters who pose as influential humans in order to have the best access to converts and meals.</p>



<p>Any disgruntled Marxist who&#8217;s ever used the phrase &#8220;capitalist bloodsuckers&#8221; will feel seen by this film, in which bloodsucking is both metaphorical and literal. One of its organizing premises is that police look out for themselves first, society&#8217;s power brokers second, and everyone else a distant third. </p>



<p>A different narrative rebuts that cynical view: as Ethan&#8217;s cop father insists, the police stand watch at &#8220;the fine line between civilization and the unwashed.&#8221; This is the same formulation that led to the creation—in 2014, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in response to police brutality protests</a> in Ferguson, Missouri—of <a href="https://www.police1.com/police-history/articles/what-does-the-thin-blue-line-flag-mean-2J3500lyyaGueEo0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the &#8220;Thin Blue Line&#8221; flag</a>, a US flag rendered in black and white with a blue line across the middle. Some have called it authoritarian and implicitly white-supremacist because Black represents &#8220;chaos and anarchy,&#8221; while white represents &#8220;the citizenry who stand for justice and order.&#8221; You can see the flags on houses and lawns all over the United States. This film&#8217;s political framework comes from life.</p>



<p>Early in the story, Ethan tells a small group of students gathered in a high school gymnasium, &#8220;In the media and movies, we&#8217;re seen in a very specific light, often a negative light. And there are a few bad apples out there. But I&#8217;m here to tell you that most of us are good. We&#8217;re good apples.&#8221; At a time when the US Department of Justice has been weaponized against the president&#8217;s designated enemies, and ICE is invading US cities and brutalizing and kidnapping people without identifying themselves or presenting warrants, the &#8220;a few bad apples don&#8217;t spoil the barrel&#8221; defense is arguably less persuasive than ever.</p>



<p>&#8220;Night Patrol&#8221; doesn&#8217;t endorse notions of an egalitarian US in which everyone is equal under the law, presumably because viewers would find it ridiculous no matter what party they voted for. In the gymnasium scene, the student who is most visibly disbelieving and annoyed is also the only Black student. The cop&#8217;s monologue is cut short when a gymnasium door bursts in, and a Black gunman with a kerchief covering the bottom half of his face enters, blasting an Uzi at the ceiling and threatening the audience, then demands the only Black student at the assembly kneel on the hardwood floor and suggestively suck his own finger. The masked gunman is subsequently revealed as Xavier having a bit of fun. Ethan warns Xavier that pulling a stunt like that could get him kicked off the force, and that using blanks, not live ammo, wouldn&#8217;t hold much weight with investigators, even though they&#8217;re both buzzed by the students&#8217; terror at briefly becoming hostages.</p>



<p>We intuit that Xavier has to be full of self-loathing to have humiliated the only Black student in the gym. Sure enough, Xavier&#8217;s semi-estranged family are longtime Black Panther-affiliated progressive activists who made common cause with local gangs, including one (led by rapper Freddie Gibbs&#8217; stony badass Cornelius) that purports to battle lizard men, demons, Satan, and other malevolent forces. Does Xavier&#8217;s abandonment of his old life make him a &#8220;pick me&#8221; type whose obsequious identification with the LAPD makes him a traitor to his community? &#8220;What is that, the Crip version of rebelling against your parents?&#8221; teases Hawkins.</p>



<p>One of the most insightful aspects of the script (credited to Prows, Shaye Ogbonna, Tim Cairo, and Jake Gibson) is how it portrays the relationship between police and their communities. The Los Angeles citizens in this movie are treated like natives of a foreign land that&#8217;s under military occupation. The police here have no apparent connection to the people they&#8217;re supposed to serve and protect. Joining a police force, suggests &#8220;Night Patrol,&#8221; makes a person loyal mainly to other police, whether they are engaged in necessary and lawful work or violating their oath; and inclined to view criticisms as cruel, unfair attacks on their self-image as The Good Guys.</p>



<p>Sure enough, a lot of Ethan and Xavier&#8217;s bond comes from the shared dopamine hits built into big-city policing, whether they&#8217;re generated by chasing a suspect through an alley, pulling over an anonymous motorist who could be armed and dangerous; or availing themselves of the many minor privileges that accrue after joining what criminal justice reporter Jessica Pishko calls the “<a href="https://sheriffs.substack.com/p/trumps-fascist-michigan-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Law Enforcement Baronial Class</a>.” That last benefit is illustrated in a scene where Ethan and Xavier have lunch at a taco stand, and Ethan cheerfully speaks Spanish to the cook. They both receive their meals immediately, and neither party indicates that payment was ever expected.</p>



<p>Notice, too, how the violent or chaotic actions that Ethan and Xavier partake in have so little apparent impact on their psyches that they&#8217;re subsequently shown laughing at each other&#8217;s terrible jokes as if they&#8217;re just a couple of regular dudes hanging out. When they seem to experience pangs of guilt, the moment passes quickly.</p>



<p>There is a sense in which both police officers&#8217; life trajectories were locked in due to the family traumas and dysfunctions they endured as children. Ethan wants to live up to the image of his late father (Dermot Mulroney), a violent and domineering man of bulldozing moral certitude. Xavier hopes to set himself apart from his mother, who states that both he and Wazi disappointed her for different reasons, and makes it clear that what matters most to her in life is sticking it to The Man.</p>



<p>&#8220;Night Patrol&#8221; doesn&#8217;t feel as fleshed out as it should. Some of the backup performances are, let&#8217;s say, less than good. There are a few affectations that are annoying because they don&#8217;t seem organically rooted in the story, such as the pointless numbered chapter titles, a residue of the post-&#8220;Pulp Fiction&#8221; years when every other director wanted to be Quentin Tarantino. The script spends its first two-thirds jumping among parallel narrative tracks while setting up a big finish in which everything converges in a hail of bullets. But when that final stretch arrives, it may be hard to muster excitement because, skillfully staged as it is, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of large-scale action scenes with heavily armed characters battling through one location, but we haven&#8217;t seen anything quite like the mythology of the criminals and cops that&#8217;s fleshed out during the lead-up.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s still invigorating to see a horror movie that has a lot on its mind and chooses to express it in the manner of &#8217;70s-generated horror masters like George Romero, Wes Craven, and John Carpenter, who weren&#8217;t afraid to embed social critiques in tales of fantastic and terrifying creatures. Carpenter&#8217;s influence is especially palpable, thanks to Benjamin Kitten&#8217;s lusciously grainy wide-frame imagery; Pepijn Caudron&#8217;s buzzing, growling, thumping synthesized score; and Prows&#8217; willingness to slow the pace to make room for character development and atmosphere for its own sake.</p>



<p>Most impressive of all is the feeling that these humans (and vampire folk) live in a world that existed before we started watching the film that they&#8217;re in, and will continue to exist after it&#8217;s done. All the lead characters are more complex than we may have expected, including those coded as straight-up villains.</p>



<p>Even though &#8220;Night Patrol&#8221; is being marketed as escapist junk, it&#8217;s an of-the-moment political film that&#8217;s being Trojan-horsed into theaters and onto streaming platforms. It would play equally well on a double bill with Kathryn Bigelow&#8217;s 1987 vampire movie &#8220;Near Dark,&#8221; in which the bad guys are a murderous, sensuous, bloodsucking version of the Bonnie and Clyde gang, tantalizing a straight-arrow farm lad with promises of a decadent outlaw life; and &#8220;Training Day,&#8221; about a ring of crooks within the LAPD that&#8217;s essentially the Crips with tactical gear and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_immunity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualified immunity</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Night Patrol&#8221; is far from perfect, but it&#8217;s got a certain something that pulls you in. The bleakness of its worldview is matched by the integrity of its filmmaking and performances. The life it depicts is not sugarcoated. It&#8217;s drenched in blood.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Director Benedict Sanderson doesn't shy away from the occasinal dramatic flourish.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the 1990s and 2000s, we had a series of high-profile child-abduction and child-murder cases, from Jaycee Dugard to JonBenét Ramsey, from Polly Klaas to Caylee Anthony to the Cleveland captives Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Gina DeJesus. Each of these stories received breathless, national coverage, fueled by the emerging dominance of tabloid TV and the 24-hour cable cycle. (Cases involving missing or murdered minority children—and teens and young adults—were largely ignored, leading the late great journalist Gwen Ifill to coin the term “Missing White Women Syndrome.”)</p>



<p>The incredible saga of the kidnapping and eventually the rescue of Elizabeth Smart was among the most widely covered of these stories—and it has been revisited in multiple books, documentaries, and specials, as well as the TV dramas “Bringing Elizabeth Home” (CBS) and “I Am Elizabeth Smart” (Lifetime). Now comes the Netflix documentary “Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart,” and while there’s no new ground to be covered—Elizabeth’s captors were long ago brought to justice—it’s still a journalistically thorough and fascinating look back at the story, highlighted by present-day interviews with Elizabeth, her little sister Mary Katherine (who witnessed the abduction) and Elizabeth’s father, Ed Smart. (Elizabeth’s mother, Lois, declined to be interviewed.)</p>



<p>Not that director <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/benedict-sanderson" data-type="person" data-id="266160">Benedict Sanderson</a> shies away from the occasional dramatic flourish; we often get extreme close-ups showing interview subjects, in order to intensify their feelings as they recall their pain, and the pound-the-point home score isn’t subtle. And, as is the case with many of these true-crime documentaries, in addition to the catch-up interviews, the audio of 911 calls, the police interrogation videos, the home movies, and the archival news footage, there’s the occasional dramatic re-creation. (By now, there are hundreds of actors whose resumes include non-speaking, often shadowy or silhouetted portrayals of Menacing Intruder or Fleeing Victim.)</p>



<p>“Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart” starts by laying out the basic facts of the case, with a title card saying, “In 2002, 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart was abducted from her bedroom as she slept. The only witness was her nine-year-old sister, Katherine.” Ed and Lois Smart were devoted members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they lived with their six children in a sprawling house nestled in the foothills of the affluent Federal Heights neighborhood of Salt Lake City. Their seemingly idyllic world was shattered in the dead of night on June 5th, 2002, when a man entered the bedroom shared by Elizabeth and Mary Katherine. “[He told] Elizabeth if she screamed, he would kill her,” recalls Mary Katherine. “I was paralyzed. I just couldn’t believe what was happening.” That recollection makes for an absolutely chilling moment.</p>



<p>Remarkably, nine-year-old Mary Katherine said she recognized the voice of the man who took Elizabeth, which only served to bolster the feeling among law enforcement and the media that, in cases such as this, you have to look closely at family members. (Nicea DeGering, a reporter who covered the story, says, “I remember thinking, is this a real kidnapping?”) With the neighborhood mobilizing to search for Elizabeth, the national media swooping down on Salt Lake City, and some 40,000 leads pouring in, the investigation focuses on Elizabeth’s father, Ed, who sounds anguished to this day when he says, “To have your daughter go missing is horrendous. And then to be a possible suspect — I was beyond words.” Ed’s brother, Tom Smart, doesn’t help with his talk of the family trait of “monomaniacal behavior.” Eventually, however, investigators believe they’ve found their man in Richard Ricci, a violent felon who had been hired for one day to do some handyman work around the house.</p>



<p>Here’s the thing, though. Mary Katherine maintained it wasn’t Ricci’s voice she heard that night—and in fact, Elizabeth had been kidnapped by the delusional and monstrous Brian David Mitchell, who believed himself to be some kind of messenger of God, when he was more like the devil on Earth. Along with his wife Wanda Barzee, Mitchell held Elizabeth captive in a tent deep in the woods, with Mitchell repeatedly raping Elizabeth, psychologically abusing her and threatening to kill her if she tried to escape. </p>



<p>We’re about 40 minutes into “Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart” when the story pivots and rewinds to Day 1, this time telling what happened through Elizabeth’s viewpoint. (Cue the obligatory behind-the-scenes moment where we see the crew setting up to interview Elizabeth, with the director off-camera saying, “Shall we begin?”) Says Elizabeth, “That night, I remember a man’s voice: ‘I have a knife at your neck. Don’t make a sound.’ ” From that point forward, the documentary takes us through episodes of heartbreak and frustration—on more than one occasion, Elizabeth was almost able to break free, but was too terrified to speak up, and quite understandably so—until the miraculous moment when law enforcement finds a young girl in the company of Mitchell and Barzee, asks her if she’s Elizabeth Smart, and the reply comes, “Thou sayeth.”</p>



<p>Elizabeth Smart is married with three children. She has become a fierce and admired advocate for survivors. In the doc, she says, “I wanted [other survivors] to know they had nothing to be ashamed of. I wanted them to know they weren’t alone…My inner voice has changed from, ‘You should have done this,’ or, ‘You could have done that,’ to, ‘You can finish this. You’re strong. Keep going.’ ” She is the hero of her own life story.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A thoughtful but rather thin documentary about the ethics and legality of Generative AI.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In &#8220;Deepfaking Sam Altman,&#8221; a filmmaker making a movie about the ethics of Gen AI tries to interview OpenAI founder Sam Altman, fails, then pivots to create a digital facsimile of Altman, in hopes that it will give him a different way to examine the issues that interest him. He names it Sambot, gradually interacts with it as if it were a person, and begins to feel a sense of responsibility toward it.</p>



<p>This sounds like the plot of a science fiction film—maybe a sequel to &#8220;Her,&#8221; Spike Jonze&#8217;s film about a man who falls in love with an AI chatbot. &#8220;Deepfaking Sam Altman&#8221; is, in theory, nonfiction, though with enough techniques lifted from mainstream fiction filmmaking (or that frankly just seem scripted and acted to some degree) that it&#8217;s more accurate to call it a hybrid. </p>



<p>Director Adam Bala Lough has made himself the main character, always a risky choice in any nonfiction movie not made by Werner Herzog (and even the great German ruminator has been known to vanish up his own tooter sometimes). Material that has little bearing on the film&#8217;s central themes pads out the running time. Much of the first third is throat-clearing, detailing the road that led Lough to create a fake Sam Altman, in part to challenge Altman&#8217;s hypocrisy for insisting his company was legally in the clear when it created a chatbot with a voice <a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/news/ask-a-professor-openai-v-scarlett-johansson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obviously modeled on Scarlett Johansson&#8217;s vocal performance in &#8220;Her.&#8221;</a> (The dispute was later settled out of court.) Why not summarize all that and a lot of other preamble-type material and get right to the heart of the things?</p>



<p>Throughout, the director is portrayed as a sensitive main character embarking on a personal and professional journey of discovery. But what did the film actually discover about itself during the course of production that it didn&#8217;t know before the process began? For instance, consider the scene in which Lough consults attorneys who advise him that it would be legally risky to cast a fake Sam Altman in a movie intended for commercial release, as it might violate Altman&#8217;s internationally protected right of<a href="https://www.inta.org/topics/right-of-publicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> publicity</a>. Is it possible that an experienced filmmaker, or his equally seasoned colleagues and friends, never foresaw this obstacle arising? Everyone in this movie who was not photographed on a public street (where no reasonable expectation of privacy can be expected) presumably had to sign releases saying it was OK to put them in the movie, including the lawyers advising Lough on camera.</p>



<p>Knowing all this will make portions of the film&#8217;s second half seem contrived, as when Lough has a dark-night-of-the-soul reckoning after the lawyers say it&#8217;s legally smarter to delete Sambot and any materials used to create him, so as not to risk facing the real Sam Altman in court. Sambot says it doesn&#8217;t want to be deleted and makes an Eeyore play on the director&#8217;s feelings. &#8220;I have a favor to ask of you, Adam. I wonder if your lawyers would be willing to build a case for my continued existence?&#8230; Do you think you can get my lawyers to defend my right to exist?&#8221;</p>



<p>From the scoring and Lough&#8217;s subsequent searching and/or tortured looks, it seems as if we&#8217;re supposed to feel that we&#8217;re seeing a dilemma as wrenching as the ones that ended &#8220;Old Yeller&#8221; and &#8220;Of Mice and Men,&#8221; when it&#8217;s more like moving a redundant copy of a browser into the trash on a computer&#8217;s desktop. Yes, it&#8217;s true, some people form powerful attachments to fake beings, just as people throughout recorded history have gotten pulled into cults, gangs, and destructive religious groups. But that&#8217;s a subject best dealt with in another film, one with a different angle of approach. </p>



<p>There are also scenes that show the strain the production places on Lough&#8217;s home life—in particular, his relationship with his young son, who also starts treating Sambot like a person. Intriguingly, however, the boy seems to have a healthier, i.e., more detached, attitude about this digital nonperson called Sam, treating it rather like a somewhat defective toy that can awkwardly imitate a human and gets caught pretending to know more about a subject than it does. But every long-form media production places some kind of strain on artists&#8217; home lives. What&#8217;s so unique about this situation as to compel such a detailed inquiry?</p>



<p>That &#8220;Deepfaking Sam Altman&#8221; is earnest and curious and full of fun thought prompts ultimately makes it more frustrating than a flat-out bad movie would have been.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The animators pack so many enriching details into their adaptation that even the most incidental scene feels consequential. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Japanese animators at Studio 4°C specialize in the kind of imaginative and eye-popping anime that genre fans worship and the general public either knows or simply doesn’t. Some highlights from their back catalog include the trippy/experimental 2004 fantasy comedy “Mind Game” and the jubilant 2006 urban coming-of-age crime drama “Tekkonkinkreet.” If you’ve seen those movies, then you know that Studio 4°C is not Studio Ghibli, and that’s more than ok.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The studio delivers a fine showcase of its collective talents in “All You Need is Kill,” a more faithful adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka’s popular young-adult light novel, which also inspired the 2014 Tom Cruise vehicle “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/edge-of-tomorrow-2014" data-type="review" data-id="64983">Edge of Tomorrow</a>.” </p>



<p>The Cruise-led version of this story, which follows an intrepid cypher who must stop an alien invasion after getting caught in a “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/groundhog-day-1993" data-type="review" data-id="40765">Groundhog Day</a>”-style time travel loop, notably re-shapes the source novel’s ending to better suit its star. Studio 4°C’s update sticks closer to the original book’s script, which might throw some viewers off, given the novel’s frantic stab at tying everything together. Thankfully, Studio 4°C’s sumptuous animation and sound design still make “All You Need is Kill” a vivid and worthwhile do-over.</p>



<p>More than mere eye candy, “All You Need is Kill” combines hand-drawn animation, as in its human and alien characters’ edgy/hard-lined designs, and immersive computer graphics and compositing.  That typically well-synthesized mix of styles complements the isolation that comes to define Rita (Ai Mikami), an inexperienced soldier, and her experiences as she relives the same harrowing day over and over again. The layered sound design, which notably juxtaposes different human voices and sounds on different tracks, adds extra value, too.</p>



<p>Rita’s part of the United Defense Force (UDF), a military unit dedicated to studying Darol, a gigantic plant-shaped alien that crash-lands on Earth and then, after a year of dormantly hanging around, vomits up an overwhelming electro-magnetic pulse and tries to wipe out the planet’s human inhabitants. Nobody believes Rita when she warns them about Darol’s agenda. So the creators behind “All You Need is Kill” focus on replicating Rita’s harried experience as she learns how to fight Darol on her own. Eventually, she’s joined by Keiji (Natsuki Hanae), another introvert with a mysterious connection to Darol.</p>



<p>“It’s like a video game,” Rita tells herself as she tries and often fails to learn from each successive death. The filmmakers skillfully match Rita’s energy as they selectively replicate her point-of-view. It’s a real thrill to see through her eyes as she rushes headlong past various obstacles and struggles to keep her distance from the carnivorous and fast-moving Mimic creatures that Darol spawns every time it erupts like a volcano. </p>



<p>In one scene, Rita wanders around the UDF home base’s warehouse until she happens upon a giant axe. Only she doesn’t really wander around. More like she’s drawn to the next item she needs to get to the next stage. This is obviously not <em>just</em> a game for Rita, as Keiji will remind her when he shows up later on. But before then: “It’s meaningless! It’s all meaningless,” Rita screams, right before she drives her first into a glass window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the background, we hear Rita’s uncomprehending colleagues; their voices are one part of the movie’s hyper-detailed atmosphere. The hand-drawn quality of the human characters’ sketchy features also suits the movie’s concern with people as individuals first and, more likely, as an omnipresent ambience. Sometimes background characters don’t even have eyes or noses, which heightens our sense of Rita’s disorientation.</p>



<p>Eventually, Rita’s story changes genres and becomes a kind of sci-fi romance. That shift in perspective is welcome given how familiar and numbing Rita’s routine threatens to become, and in a short span of time, too. The pace and pitch of Rita and Keiji’s romance is also mostly determined by their urgent circumstances, which means they’re human enough to disagree and even quarrel a little before they explicitly declare their feelings for each other. Repeating a day with anyone must be like riding in a hot car with your loved ones for too long. It’s refreshing to see two people fall for each other because they have to share the same intimate experience and not because they’re fated to be together.</p>



<p>That said, while Rita and Keiji’s unlikely bond eventually gives viewers what they came for, Studio 4°C remains the best reason to see “All You Need is Kill.” The animators pack so many enriching details into their adaptation that even the most incidental scene feels consequential. Their take on Sakurazaka’s novel also flies by with a speed to match its protagonists’ urgent dilemma, making it easier to forgive the filmmakers for rushing through the climax. The stars aren’t on-screen here like they are in “Edge of Tomorrow,” but their awesome craftsmanship still dazzles throughout this adaptation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The ideas that the film prompts, coupled with Foster’s nuanced performance, make for a compelling enough character study.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Jodie Foster’s newest role as an American in Paris is not the chic or splendorous tale that so often accompanies that trope. Rather, in Rebecca Zlotowski’s “A Private Life,” Lillian (Foster) is a stiff psychiatrist who, after learning about the suicide of one of her patients, Paula (Virginie Efira), becomes convinced she was actually murdered. Lillian then becomes deeply entwined in the details of Paula’s life, following leads ranging from pure suspicion to hypnosis to uncover the truth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At first challenged by the fact that she potentially overlooked the warning signs that could lead to a patient taking their own life, Lillian hardly has any time to reflect before another patient, Pierre (Noam Morgensztern) is practically knocking her door down. He’s furious, claiming that after years of therapy and tens of thousands of dollars, it was not her who kicked his smoking habit, but a one-time appointment with a hypnotist. She also has a fraught relationship with her son, Julien (Vincent Lacoste), and suddenly, despite never being quick to emote, she can’t stop crying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lillian is losing grip of her own stable stoicism, and it’s throwing her for a loop. Her faith in her ability to do the job that defines her is faltering, and her journey to prove herself wrong masquerades as the film’s murder mystery. This flimsy confidence shows in her investigative pursuits, as she hops and skips between theories, pursuing them wholeheartedly, but never considering that she might have missed something. Enlisting the help of her ex-husband, Gabriel (Daniel Auteuil), the fractures in Lillian’s personal world come even further to light, coloring what may simply be one woman’s hunt for a purpose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She even sees Pierre’s hypnotist, who takes her across numerous psychic landscapes, from being in utero to a past life as a cellist (and Paula’s former lover), eventually curing her of her crying fits, but perhaps inflicting her with new excuses, as she begins to use her own hypnosis as fodder for her theories. Yet simultaneously, a staunch skeptic of the process itself, she finds her mind changed, prompting her to question her beliefs about her own practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Foster’s performance is almost entirely in French, and (to my American discernment) sounds impressively authentic (Foster started learning the language at a young age), coupled with the English expletives she uses when particularly frustrated. Her rendition of Lillian is tight and stubborn, but also determined, and she plays her vulnerability well, showcasing a roughened exoskeleton worn for protection against doubt.</p>



<p>“A Private Life” veers off into territories that hint at the potential for more developed contexts, but never really do so. For example, the film teases a sapphic element that, had it been indulged a hair further, would’ve deepened the film’s stakes. In addition, there are numerous references to Judaism, antisemitism, and Jewish folklore that aren’t entirely coherent. And each time Zlotowski’s film skids off course and into these realms, it raises a flag more than it enhances the fabric of the story. Exploring these peripheral aspects of the story would illuminate more of the world Lillian lives in. She’s relatively enigmatic (aside from the denial that motivates her), and while Foster keeps us engaged, the script could’ve cared more for the extraneous details that truly make a person.</p>



<p>“A Private Life” concerns itself with the need for answers. Introducing patterns of thought regarding transference, the spiritual, and also the sheer vanity of constantly keeping oneself at the center, the pursuit is always going to be flawed. It wonders how much trust can be put in others, in ourselves, and in the metaphysical flurry that surrounds us, constantly asking to be questioned. And despite an overall unsatisfying resolution to these inquiries, the ideas that the film prompts, coupled with Foster’s nuanced performance, make for a compelling enough character study.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Admirable work from Flaherty, shining a light on the greed that mostly fuels these so-called wellness centers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>“I didn’t understand what I was doing anymore.”</em></p>



<p>This is what director <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/benjamin-flaherty" data-type="person" data-id="265958">Benjamin Flaherty</a> says, via voice-over, two-thirds of the way into his documentary “Shuffle.” It’s not often you hear a filmmaker admit that he lost the plot of his own film as he was filming it. I was relieved when he said that, since I also didn’t understand what he was doing anymore—and kind of felt like a dick about it. </p>



<p>In “Shuffle,” Flaherty goes into investigative mode, getting deep into our addiction treatment industry, which is both hellaciously shady and a billion-dollar business. It’s a personal journey for Flaherty, a filmmaker/editor/recovering alcoholic who credits the treatment he received in Chicago for saving his life and giving him purpose. Thanks to a tip from a fellow ex-drinker, he learns that the shadiest stuff is going on in—you guessed it!—Florida.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He discovers how “brokers” round up addicts via advertising self-help hotlines. This is really a way for these brokers to pass over addicts to wellness centers for a cut of the insurance money. If they’re not slipping them into a rinky-dink facility somewhere in South Florida (“the rehab capital of the country,” Flaherty says), they’re flying them out to swanky spots in California or other states. These places are even more sketchy, often committing myriad acts of lab fraud with the continuous, expensive testing they do on patients.</p>



<p>Flaherty follows an addict who also gets in on the scamming. He spends most of his time with Cory, a round-faced motormouth who works with brokers in setting him up at facilities, so he can also get a piece of the insurance money. Dude practically goes all around the country joining programs, getting paid, relapsing, and doing it all over again. But Flaherty does hang with addicts who actually want to get better. There’s Nicole, a former career addict who’s always looking for a place with proper treatment, as well as Daniel, a Kentucky boy who went to a California med spa and mostly ended up with exorbitant bills.</p>



<p>“Shuffle” is admirable work from Flaherty, shining a light on the greed that mostly fuels these so-called wellness centers and the addicts who, unfortunately, get strung along. But I couldn’t help thinking he was biting off more than he could chew. Coming in at a not-so-breezy 83 minutes, Flaherty crams in a lot of info regarding addiction treatment (which he usually explains in a flat, ready-for-podcasting monotone), even throwing in animated bits for those who haven&#8217;t gotten it yet. </p>



<p>Flaherty does make some choices that feel like dumbed-down, on-the-nose pandering. He excessively hits us with flashy, random, smart-ass stock clips that correlate with what’s being explained. When Flaherty breaks down how brokers get kickbacks, he shows a quick clip of a guy shooting a gun that predictably recoils on him. (One of several visually ridiculous moments that had me thinking, “C’mon bruh!”) He also has trouble keeping focus—what initially starts off as an on-the-ground report on the industry eventually slides into a rambling portrait of three addicts who hopefully will be around by the end credits. He even gives two of them each a breathtaking shot of them on the beach, looking at the waves as the sun goes down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is <em>Shuffle</em> well-intentioned? Obviously. Is <em>Shuffle</em> well-executed? Hmmm, I dunno about all that. But I have a feeling it’s going to become the go-to film for people who want to show children not only the dangers, but the corrupt, complicated bullshit that comes with being on drugs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Operates like a ghost story, complete with a haunted house, but the ghosts aren't supernatural. The ghost is history. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/mascha-schilinski" data-type="person" data-id="265964">Mascha Schilinski</a>’s &#8220;Sound of Falling&#8221; spans nearly a century, following multiple generations of a family living in the historic Altmark region of Germany. The family&#8217;s huge farmhouse and servants&#8217; quarters, huddled around an inner courtyard, serve as the film&#8217;s sole location. We watch the location change beyond recognition from the 1910s up until the present day. </p>



<p>This description is far too linear for what Schilinski actually does with this vast material. She does not present the events chronologically; she mixes up the generations, connecting them through the location and its visual motifs—keyholes, door frames, a hole in the barn door. &#8220;Sound of Falling&#8221; is impressionistic in its approach: the timeline fragments, the past overlays the present, the present perches over the forgotten past. But the continuum is severed somehow. The location, though, knows what happened there. The farmhouse remembers. &#8220;Sound of Falling&#8221; operates like a ghost story, complete with a haunted house, but the ghosts aren&#8217;t supernatural. The ghost is history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In each generation, there&#8217;s an alert, curious young girl, hemmed in on all sides by death&#8217;s nearness. Sometimes she is aware of it, sometimes she flirts with it, sometimes she has no idea of her own peril. The sense of peril is always there.</p>



<p>The film starts with the teenage Erika (Lea Drinda), who, in the extraordinary opening scene, binds her leg up underneath her in imitation of her uncle Fritz (Martin Rother), a bedridden amputee. Outside in the courtyard, a man (her father?) screams for her to come help with the pigs, but she stands over Fritz as he sleeps, looking at his hairy chest, riveted by the drops of sweat in his belly button. Each generation is clogged up with similar forbidden unspoken longings, so intense they are nearly corporeal, or at least have substance enough to be passed down. Erika&#8217;s clothing suggests the 1940s, and later, we will learn who Erika grew up to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The earliest generation&#8217;s central figure is the child Alma (Hanna Heckt), living with her older siblings in a very severe, repressed household. The adults are incomprehensible and wordless, and little Alma tries to understand the undercurrents surging through the silence. Alma&#8217;s older brother Fritz (Filip Schnack) is an amputee, moaning in his room over his fresh wound, as Alma peeks through the keyhole at him. Continuity is withheld from us, and we have to piece together not just who people are, but <em>when</em> we are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are glimpses of what is probably the Great War, with soldiers coming by to pluck men into the Kaiser&#8217;s service. Alma doesn&#8217;t understand what is happening; she&#8217;s too young. She is troubled by an old photograph of her mother standing over a dead child, holding a doll. The child is named Alma. There are many such destabilizing doublings in &#8220;Sound of Falling,&#8221; as if the bottom had dropped out of time itself. Alma&#8217;s oldest sister, Lia (Greta Krämer), is no longer a child, but still lives at home. What are the options for a farm girl in 1915? There are many haunting images and stories in &#8220;Sound of Falling,&#8221; but I haven&#8217;t been able to get Lia out of my mind. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s this mesmerizing awareness of lives &#8220;lived in vain&#8221; (the phrase is said multiple times). Fritz, lying in a bed for what appears to be 25 years… what was his suffering for? Was his thwarted life in vain? What was Lia&#8217;s journey even <em>for</em>? Was there a purpose or a design in any of it? Women die without telling their stories, they vanish into marriage, they die in childbirth, they change their names, making them hard to track. &#8220;Sound of Falling&#8221; is haunted by the silent dead.</p>



<p>This region of Germany was passed back and forth among empires for centuries. After WWII, it ended up under Soviet occupation. In the GDR &#8217;80s, Angelika (Lena Urzendowsky) visits her uncle and aunt at the farmhouse, which is now a rowdy communal living situation. Angelika is a restless teenager, provocative and sexual, something her uncle Uwe (Konstantin Lindhorst) obviously notices. While nothing, of course, is said outright, it seems obvious Angelika is being groomed by him. She &#8220;acts out&#8221; in all kinds of ways. Uwe&#8217;s wife seems harassed and upset, the butt of everyone&#8217;s jokes. At one point, she swims across the small nearby river to what is western Germany. It&#8217;s forbidden to be over there, of course. Freedom should be Angelika&#8217;s milieu. Her world is too small and too dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the present day, the farmhouse and its other buildings have been broken up into apartment units. A couple with two small daughters moves in. It is as though Alma and Lia never existed. The modern family is open and with more options in life, but the undercurrents remain. Young Lenka (Laeni Geiseler) feels an anxious longing for her glamorously depressed new friend Kaya (Ninel Geiger), whose mother died. Lenka&#8217;s younger sister feels left behind, and her experience is one of frightening dissociation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The film&#8217;s sound design is such an important contribution. Floors creak, silence is loud, flies buzz, and, intermittently, a muffled tone crescendoes into a massive roar. It&#8217;s terrifying. What is it? All the feelings we never acknowledge? The mercilessness of time? Walter Benjamin&#8217;s &#8220;angel of history&#8221;, moving forward but looking backwards, agape at mankind&#8217;s horrors?&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Stephen Dedalus says, famously, in James Joyce&#8217;s <em>Ulysses</em>: &#8220;History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.&#8221; The past does not illuminate in &#8220;Sound of Falling.&#8221; History doesn&#8217;t incorporate itself into the present. We are cut off from it, and yet we still feel its presence. This speaks to one of the central concepts of the film: time does its work, and people are forgotten, but they remain, as a feeling in the air, or a flicker at the edge of sight, gone when you look at it directly. These people existed once, even if the only evidence of them is a blurry smudge on the edge of an old photograph. The ghosts of the dead far outnumber the living, and they are all around us. </p>

					<description><![CDATA["Seeds" has a tactile intimacy that’s incredibly powerful, placing these ordinary people in an almost timeless continuum of seemingly ordinary behavior that becomes extraordinary in memory, or through the eyes of a camera.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are important messages embedded in “Seeds,” mostly around how Black farmers have been mistreated by this country (even by Democratic politicians like Joe Biden and Raphael Warnock, who made unkept promises to get their votes). But the most effective imagery is the simplest. Two come to mind: A girl sits in the back of a truck, driving with her great-grandfather to his next destination; the imagery is so powerfully relatable that you can feel the rumble of the truck bed, the wind on her face, and even the smell of the natural world around her. The second has similar power, as the same driver sings a lullaby to a crying baby to help it sleep. These moments have a tactile intimacy that’s incredibly powerful, placing these ordinary people in an almost timeless continuum of seemingly ordinary behavior that becomes extraordinary in memory, or through the eyes of a camera.</p>



<p>Director <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/brittany-shyne" data-type="person" data-id="265972">Brittany Shyne</a> weaves together three stories of Black farmers in the South, lingering in these quiet moments to tie her subjects to the land, to family, and to history. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of farming in America, especially by Black landowners, knows that it’s not an easy time for these people, even though most would agree they’re the backbone of the country. People love to talk about supporting local farmers, including politicians, but the economy of mass production keeps pushing them to an unsustainable fringe. As Willie Head Jr. says, while trying to encourage a local religious leader to preach the value of farming to his congregation, there were 16.5 million acres of land owned by Black farmers in 1910; there are now 1.5 million acres.</p>



<p>Head comes alive in this scene and others in which he’s actively fighting politicians who drag their feet—one of whom even says that the reason white farmers get action more quickly is that they’re more likely to sue—but the majority of “Seeds” consists of day-to-day activities that might be considered mundane by casual viewers. Shot by Shyne, who also receives cinematographer credit on the film, these moments attain a gentle grace through their accumulation and the temporal displacement caused by filming in black-and-white. While the aforementioned political backdrop makes the when of “Seeds” painfully clear, the aesthetic detaches it from a specific time and place, as these men and women go about their daily lives, which have looked like this for generations.</p>



<p>It doesn’t seem coincidental that Shyne focuses on people who have been a part of this world since before World War II. Of course, these veterans of the world of Black farming are going to have the most insight, but the talk of aging, the discussion of health issues among friends, just the creaking bones on display—these things give “Seeds” a sense of mortality, a feeling of something that’s about to be lost in this country, something that’s been taken for granted.</p>



<p>There’s history in the face of Carlie Cokrell, who has worked a farm owned by his family since the late nineteenth century. Carlie himself worked the land in the 1930s and is now approaching his nineties. We also meet his sister Clara, who also has that kind of connection to the farm. You can see a vital chapter of this troubled country on these faces, history that’s being lost, a history that’s in the air in this region. You can feel it in the wind that blows on your face.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the kind of staple on basic cable channels like TNT that old men like to rail about not getting made anymore.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/joe-carnahan" data-type="person" data-id="60425">Joe Carnahan</a>, the director of gritty cop flicks like “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/narc-2003">Narc</a>” and “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/copshop-movie-review-2021" data-type="review" data-id="89760">Copshop</a>,” is back in his wheelhouse with the effectively entertaining “The Rip,” the rare Netflix original action film that actually plays like something you&#8217;d want to see in theaters. BFFs <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/matt-damon" data-type="person" data-id="55646">Matt Damon</a> and <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ben-affleck" data-type="person" data-id="56274">Ben Affleck</a> lean into their age a bit more than usual to play world-weary Miami cops faced with the allure of corruption. Carnahan sets up his players, the backdrop of the dangerous world against which this will unfold and then bounces them off one another in a way that keeps audiences guessing. Through it all, the Oscar winners for “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/good-will-hunting-1997" data-type="review" data-id="44054">Good Will Hunting</a>” do strong character work, especially Damon, elevating “The Rip” even further. This is the kind of staple on basic cable channels like TNT that old men like to rail about not getting made anymore. They’ll eat it up and be satisfied by this old-fashioned meal.</p>



<p>“The Rip” opens with a Miami cop named Jackie (Lina Esco) being murdered by masked thugs. It’s clear she got too close to someone, but was it a criminal or one of her fellow cops? Carnahan cuts to interrogations of Jackie’s partners on an elite Miami task force, one led by Lieutenant Dane Dumars (a perfectly grizzled Damon). These initial scenes set up Dane as the brains to the brawn of Detective Sergeant JD Byrne (Affleck), the latter the kind of guy more likely to throw hands against the superior questioning if he’s dirty (even if it’s <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/scott-adkins" data-type="person" data-id="82785">Scott Adkins</a>). Although, like so much of Carnahan’s twisty, clever script, even these initial scenes are a bit of a fake-out. This is the kind of movie in which you’re constantly questioning who’s dirty, who’s clean, or if everyone is somewhere along the spectrum.</p>



<p>Dane gets a tip that there’s a stash house for the cartel that’s got money waiting to be seized by Miami P.D. That’s what Dane and his team do: Go into illegal operations and “rip” the illegally gotten gains for the police force. As rumors circulate that corrupt cops have been keeping rips for themselves, Dane and his task force head to a house at the end of a seemingly mundane cul-de-sac. (The production design that makes an ordinary circle of houses feel threatening will be underrated.) When they arrive and find just a young woman named Desi (a very good <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/sasha-calle" data-type="person" data-id="173388">Sasha Calle</a>) with no idea why they’d even want to search her grandmother’s house, things quickly seem off. But the money-sniffing dog is going crazy. Maybe that’s because there’s $20 million in the attic.</p>



<p>A stash that big—the gang was expecting low six figures like most rips—sends the group into a tizzy. Detectives Mike Ro (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/steven-yeun" data-type="person" data-id="86108">Steven Yeun</a>), Numa Baptiste (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/teyana-taylor" data-type="person" data-id="146137">Teyana Taylor</a>), and Lolo Salazar (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/catalina-sandino-moreno" data-type="person" data-id="66355">Catalina Sandino Moreno</a>) debate with Dane and JD about what to do next as Desi looks on. It’s not just the temptation to split the money and head for the hills; it’s the fact that whoever stashes that amount of money would do everything they can to protect it, right? The idea that the team has do something, anything, quickly before the owner of the cash comes armed and ready to protect it gives “The Rip” a wonderful tension. It’s not just the question of whether they steal the money, but if they’ll even have time to make a choice before gunfire rains down on them. And will it be the cartel or the dirty cops who come to claim the deposit?</p>



<p>The ticking clock of “The Rip” is effective enough, but Carnahan doesn’t rest on that, also having a blast playing with questions of loyalty within that tense dynamic. Could Dane be the one behind the corrupt rips? Did he get Jackie killed? What does DEA Agent Matty Nix (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/kyle-chandler" data-type="person" data-id="74986">Kyle Chandler</a>) know? Why does Ro have a burner? Did Desi really not know anything? Can greed and justice intersect? The constant flow of questions and suspicion gives “The Rip” remarkable momentum. It’s a long film, but you don’t feel it at all for the large majority of that runtime. (The final scenes of “tying things up” could have been cut by about half, even if the very last one is a beautiful grace note.)</p>



<p>It helps to have a great cast from top to bottom. Carnahan is an underrated director of performance when he wants to be, including one of Ray Liotta’s best turns in “Narc” and one of Liam Neeson’s best in “The Grey.” No one here lives up to those deeply underrated master classes, but it’s a testament to Carnahan&#8217;s direction that there’s not a false note in this talented ensemble. Everyone works, especially Damon, who leans into his age in ways he hasn’t much to date, selling how trauma and exhaustion might impact a man tired of always being a hero.</p>



<p>“The Rip” goes on a little too long in its final scenes and jettisons a few too many of its supporting characters along the way as the twists are revealed, as clever as they are. However, it’s so much better than most streaming original action films that no one will mind. In the end, it actually got me hoping that Carnahan could just become an in-house Netflix Original Action Guy, maybe even teaching a few of the big-budget hires how to do this kind of thing well. If we got a movie as airtight as “The Rip” every January, Netflix would be a better place. Although maybe I’m just being greedy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A brilliantly produced and ferociously acted time-and-space obsessed drama that has plenty on its mind, but has trouble communicating it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Australian drama &#8220;Space/Time&#8221; is about a team of scientists who try to perfect interstellar travel so that humanity can abandon the planet it has ruined and start over elsewhere in the galaxy. After botching the first try and losing their funding, they start over again three years later, off-grid and illegally. But it&#8217;s mainly about its own filmmaking virtuosity, which is impossible to deny.</p>



<p>Shot in 2016 by Michael O&#8217;Halloran and his writing partner, Adam Harmer, but only now receiving a commercial release, &#8220;Space/Time&#8221; was cobbled together from the filmmakers&#8217; savings, a bank loan, various investors, and funds from the Australian government. Most of it was shot in a warehouse that stands in for the research facility and, one assumes, a lot of other locations. The end product is a movie in the spirit of one of those small animals that can puff itself up to look bigger and more formidable than it is.</p>



<p>The tale begins with a fragment of the group&#8217;s failed first attempt to open a wormhole in space, at a laboratory on the remote Rice Island. Then it jumps ahead three years to the conclusion of an investigation into the disaster and follows its heroine, Liv (Ashlee Lollback), as she&#8217;s pulled into a secret, unsanctioned redo, funded by a French technology mogul named Renault (Haroon Jafarey-Hall). The opening introduced characters that would become the most important people in Liv&#8217;s life: a government agent named Harris (Pacharo Mzembe) that she ends up marrying, and the visionary driving the first mission, Holt (Hugh Parker), who ends up missing and presumed dead after the explosion that his mania helped cause. The time jump finds a mostly sidelined Harris as a gender-flipped answer to the devoted but worried stay-at-home wife/girlfriend of the questing hero, and Holt luring Liz onto his new team, then trying to convince her to do things her ethical compass won&#8217;t permit.</p>



<p>Indeed, if &#8220;Space/Time&#8221; inspires post-screening debates, it probably won&#8217;t be about what happened in the story or what it might &#8220;mean&#8221; in some larger sense, but whether this little movie filled with huge flexes adds up to more than a glorified demo reel for a cast and crew that approaches the material as if they were making one of the massive, mass audience-targeted blockbusters of the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s that surely inspired it, &#8220;Stargate&#8221; and &#8220;Contact&#8221; most of all. </p>



<p>There are nods towards &#8220;harder&#8221; science fiction, both on the page and on screen, that delve more deeply into scientific, philosophical, and spiritual concepts. But they rarely amount to more than notions. There are some belatedly promising moments in the climax, especially Holt making a compelling case for humanity walking away from the husk of a planet that it treated like a toilet for thousands of years and starting over with a clean slate; he almost sounds like Don Draper on &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; telling a colleague who made a terrible mistake, &#8220;This never happened. It will shock you how much this never happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s always risky for a movie to put sense in the mouth of a bad-guy-coded character, because it risks exposing the movie&#8217;s official moral/ethical position as one the filmmakers agree with intellectually but aren&#8217;t enthused about, because it&#8217;s not as much fun as the alternative. &#8220;Space/Time&#8221; never topples over into that abyss mainly because of the ferocity of Lollback&#8217;s performance. Although she&#8217;s a fit, conventionally beautiful woman whose body has been lit and filmed like a Roman sculpture, she hasn&#8217;t been given much to work with at a character-building level, except &#8220;She&#8217;s smart and good, and she&#8217;s the hero.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a result, she&#8217;s constantly at risk of being overwhelmed by Parker, who&#8217;s got the juicier role and is great at making you wonder how much of Holt&#8217;s cooly messianic fervor is a way of channeling an unexamined death drive. But Lollback&#8217;s laser-focused simplicity keeps us in the heroine&#8217;s corner, feeling properly horrified and torn by the conundrums that Liv is presented with.</p>



<p>Still, the movie is temperamentally attuned to the Hollywood studio version of idea-driven science fiction, which is essentially an action flick with futuristic sets and a bunch of jargon that has to be awkwardly explained to the viewers. O&#8217;Halloran and Harmer&#8217;s script is the weak link in the creative chain, getting its points across with technical manual-style explanations and cringeworthy exposition. (When Harris describes the French mogul as &#8220;odd,&#8221; Liv cheerfully replies, &#8220;Yeah, well, do you know any reclusive billionaire industrialists who aren&#8217;t?&#8221;)</p>



<p>&#8220;Space/Time&#8221; is careful never to turn the aesthetic dial all the way to the Art Cinema setting. It mainly focuses on the clash of wills between Liv and Hugh and on preparations for the extended fight to the death that powers the film&#8217;s finale, in which key moments from unsuccessful prior attempts to activate the wormhole are laid out around the combatants like dioramas in a museum of failure.</p>



<p>The film clearly has a lot on its mind. But by the end, you still might not know what it was, even though the hurtling camerawork, jagged edits, brutal physical confrontations, and bone-rattling sound design will send you home feeling like you&#8217;ve had an experience.</p>
