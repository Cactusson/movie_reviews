					<description><![CDATA[It doesn’t always work, but Charli xcx, as ever, throws a wild party.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the summer of 2024, it seemed impossible to escape the neon slime color and lowercase text of Charli xcx’s sixth studio album, <em>Brat</em>. For a movie about the feel-good party season that never seemed to end, Charli and director Aidan Zamiri have taken a rather different approach than the traditional concert film featuring behind-the-scenes snippets of tour life and rehearsals leading up to a big show in front of waves of screaming fans. “The Moment” is something different, a big swing into the mockumentary genre satirizing the pressures of pop stardom and the struggle for creative control. It doesn’t always work, but Charli xcx, as ever, throws a wild party. </p>



<p>Following an exaggerated version of the star herself, Zamiri’s “The Moment” begins with a bang: Charli xcx dancing among strobe lights that change from green-to-blue-to-red complete with a flashing light warning. It’s September 2024, a few months into the newly minted “Brat” era, but the party atmosphere simmers down once Charli catches her breath. Then it’s on to London, then a British <em>Vogue </em>video shoot, terse Zoom calls in the limo, and finally, back to a party for a much-needed stress break. Being famous is a grind. The hurricane around Charli is only growing more destructive as plans for a concert film mess with her creative process and her relationship with her creative director. With the label (headed by <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/rosanna-arquette" data-type="person" data-id="44156">Rosanna Arquette</a>), managers, and now a highly-opinionated and patronizing director (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/alexander-skarsgard" data-type="person" data-id="75338">Alexander Skarsgård</a>) trying to dictate how best to keep Brat Summer going forever, Charli xcx must figure out what <em>Brat</em> means to her and whether or not to keep “the moment” going. </p>



<p>To her credit, Charli xcx throws herself into the role, playing the part of a mercurial pop star who’s trying to be cool in spite of all the outside forces meddling with her vision. She is her own wild card, quickly changing gears and sending her team scrambling to accommodate each new mandate. At times, she can be off-puttingly selfish, but again, this is the satire world version of Charli, likely standing in for similar stars who after pouring their energy into a hit-making album struggle to figure out what’s their next move. “The Moment,” which is based on Charli’s idea and experiences then expanded into a script by co-writers Zamiri and Bertie Brandes, may lack in concert footage but it is full of jokes about the industry, including a pretty clever subplot about a “Brat&#8221;-branded credit card that causes trouble for Charli and a string of never-ending ads and commercials featuring the star hawking everything from skincare to wine. In our current state of celebrity culture, it seems like an inescapable part of the machine, alongside the late-night talk show stops and long hours spent in the make-up chair. A number of cameos also add to the movie’s madcap spirit including Kate Berlant, Kylie Jenner, and Rachel Sennot, who delivers the withering line, “Are you doing the Joaquin Phoenix thing?” Indeed, there is a bit of Casey Affleck&#8217;s “I’m Still Here” in the DNA of “The Moment” as well as “This Is Spinal Tap” with the inclusion of questionable stage props and even a bit of Howard Stern’s “Private Parts,” a fictionalized version of Stern’s fight with the suits with a healthy dose of irreverent humor.</p>



<p>Zamiri, who previously collaborated with Charli xcx on her music videos “360” and “Guess,” joins forces with cinematographer Sean Price Williams to bring a stylish approach to the film, one that after the bombastic opening, doesn’t get too many opportunities to shine. Instead, the film takes on a faux cinema vérité approach, watching the events unfold when both the film crew are and aren’t there. With so much going on, “The Moment” loses its momentum about halfway through, meandering between interpersonal skirmishes a la “The Thick of It” without the quick editing or the zingers. The party spirit never quite recovers its kinetic presence. </p>



<p>Despite its messy second half, it’s amusing to watch Charli skewer her own public persona, celebrity culture, and its corporate packaging, poking fun at money-driven executives and how other creative forces can affect the way we see our favorite performers. “Brat Summer” was a vibe until it wasn’t. “The Moment” is Charli xcx’s kiss off to the end of an era, a parting gift to the last Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A labor of love by the Adams Family, a filmmaking collective, quite generous with its gore. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Mother of Flies,&#8221; about a father and daughter who get tangled up with a faith healer in a remote woodland area, is a family movie, but not in the way the phrase is usually used. It&#8217;s a nightmare parable about mortality, grief, faith, and the fragility of the flesh, made by one of the most fascinating filmmaking teams in American cinema, the Adams-Poser family.</p>



<p>The operation consists of four people: the father, John Adams, and the Mother, Toby Poser, both actors, and their daughters, Lulu and Zelda Adams. They direct, write, edit, and shoot as a team while they&#8217;re performing on camera. I have only seen a couple of their many films, &#8220;The Deeper You Dig&#8221; and &#8220;Hellbender.&#8221; Both struck me more or less as this one did: not quite my jam, for reasons that might not matter to other people, but clearly the product of talented people who&#8217;ve formed a hive-mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mother of Flies&#8221; has an opening credits sequence that&#8217;s both sensual and vile. That you can&#8217;t quite tell what&#8217;s going on makes it more effective. There&#8217;s blood, viscera, mud, slime, perhaps some other recognizable fluids. The ground is gnarled and irregular, suggestive of the roots of an ancient, old tree and a pile of corpses in a war zone. A naked person&#8217;s gore-slathered back is seen from above, raising and lowering itself, or thrusting at something beneath it. Tightly framed shots of a woman moaning and writhing evoke sexual ecstasy, the final stretch of labor before childbirth, and a body reacting to either the first hit of a powerful narcotic or an agonizing withdrawal from it. Aficionados of oil paintings from earlier centuries may be reminded of Hieronymus Bosch, Francisco Goya, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/19/jusepe-de-ribera-art-of-violence-master-of-gore-dulwich" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jusepe de Rivera</a>, and other artists know for their depictions of Hell. </p>



<p>You won&#8217;t understand the point of those images until you&#8217;re deep into the story, which is about a young woman named Mickey (Zelda Adams) who travels with her father, Jake (John Adams), to a remote woodland house to meet a healer named Solvieg (Tony Poser). Solvieg is plainly defined for the audience as some kind of mystic — a witch or sorceress — before the father and daughter have even met her. The duo hopes that Solvieg can heal Mickey, a terminal cancer patient who has exhausted all the treatment options offered by modern medicine. </p>



<p>Solvieg speaks in everything but straightforward sentences. She monologues and recites scripture or incantations. Often she&#8217;ll launch into what sounds like a parody (intentional or non-) of the &#8220;greatest hits&#8221; of 19th-century English poetry featured in textbooks. Sometimes you can barely understand what she&#8217;s saying or why she&#8217;s saying it that way. Yoda would ask her to bring it down a notch. </p>



<p>But she&#8217;s confident in her powers and demands that the father and daughter submit completely to her process, which is pre-technological. Their diet consists of mushrooms and leaves. There are no bathrooms in the house, so they have to take care of business as their forager ancestors did. It&#8217;s as if we&#8217;re seeing an account of life in a cult with one leader and just two members.</p>



<p>The movie serves up striking visuals. Solvieg&#8217;s house is covered by thick layers of vines. There&#8217;s so much vegetation encrusting the property that it&#8217;s impossible to tell where the vines end and the house begins. Solvieg is incapable of a non-dramatic entrance. She&#8217;s often silhouetted or glimpsed in half-light, framed by doorways or tree trunks. Mickey immediately begins experiencing visions—maybe hallucinations, maybe supernatural events; we can&#8217;t be sure at first. Lying in bed, she looks up at the ceiling and sees a pulpy, fleshy thing manifest itself and open up. It&#8217;s an orifice, but you can&#8217;t decide what kind because it keeps evolving.</p>



<p>And yes, as the title suggests, there are flies. Lots and lots of flies. If you tried to make a definitive list of movies with swarms of flies in them, you&#8217;d need to include this movie, which is up there with &#8220;Exorcist II: The Heretic&#8221; and the original &#8220;The Amityville Horror.&#8221; As the movie goes on, there are more sequences of intense violence, including one reminiscent of the over-the-top stories that circulated during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 1980s and &#8217;90s hysteria over day care centers</a> in the United States: ritual abuse, disfigurement, and torture, babies hacked out of their mothers&#8217; bellies.</p>



<p>There isn&#8217;t a shot that isn&#8217;t meticulously created, lovingly fussed over, and suitable for framing. In an era of often slovenly filmmaking in which the camera is treated mainly as a device to record actors saying dialogue, this is welcome. But there are times when the images are lingered on too lovingly, and you may start to feel as if the component parts of the movie are preventing it from holistic excellence.</p>



<p>There are pacing and rhythm problems too, I think. It&#8217;s not that the movie is slow-paced, with a lot of lead-up to important moments and some sequences of abstractly framed shots that are more artful than useful; it&#8217;s that the slowness lives awkwardly in that zone between &#8220;too slow&#8221; and &#8220;not slow enough,&#8221; and it makes the totality feel disjointed. Lots of horror films are objectively slower than &#8220;Mother of Flies&#8221; but still mesmerize from start to finish. This one is fascinating and often horrifically gorgeous, but not hypnotic. It&#8217;s like a book of horrifying artwork that you can close at any time and return to later, rather than a nightmare that won&#8217;t let you wake up.</p>



<p>But there are so many compensations that it&#8217;s very much worth seeing for anyone who loves horror—especially the atmospheric and gory, dread-based type, rather than the kind that is single-mindedly obsessed with staging jump-scares. The central performances are all special. They&#8217;re not studied. They feel natural, even though every other aspect of the film is unreal and uncanny. And the woods are lovely, dark and deep.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Life isn't sugarcoated here, only drenched in blood.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Writer-director <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/ryan-prows" data-type="person" data-id="120131">Ryan Prows</a>&#8216; &#8220;Night Patrol,&#8221; a cop corruption thriller that&#8217;s also a vampire movie, has a sprawling cast, but focuses on four characters. There&#8217;s Ethan Hawkins (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/justin-long" data-type="person" data-id="66255">Justin Long</a>), the son of a legendary LAPD cop (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/dermot-mulroney" data-type="person" data-id="52331">Dermot Mulroney</a>), who wants to join The Night Patrol, an unofficial, secretive, elite unit within the department that&#8217;s essentially a vampire street gang with badges and uniforms. Ethan&#8217;s partner, Xavier Carr (<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/jermaine-fowler" data-type="person" data-id="122162">Jermaine Fowler</a>), is a Black patrolman who used to be a member of the Crips gang and hopes to rise through the ranks of the police and become somebody who gives orders as well as takes them. Xavier&#8217;s brother, Wazi Carr (RJ Cyler), is a Crips-affiliated petty criminal who sleeps on a bare mattress at his mama&#8217;s house. He&#8217;s in shock over secretly witnessing an LAPD officer murdering someone close to him, and fears a Night Patrol member will kill him to prevent him from testifying about what he saw.</p>



<p>Finally, there&#8217;s Xavier and Wazi&#8217;s mama, Ayanda Carr (Nicki Micheaux), the former wife of a long-dead revolutionary who has kept a rebellious flame burning in her heart for decades. Ayada is also a mystic, a local historian of sorts, and an aficionado of supernatural lore. She&#8217;s plugged into a network of anti-authoritarians (some criminals, some not) that find and kill monsters who pose as influential humans in order to have the best access to converts and meals.</p>



<p>Any disgruntled Marxist who&#8217;s ever used the phrase &#8220;capitalist bloodsuckers&#8221; will feel seen by this film, in which bloodsucking is both metaphorical and literal. One of its organizing premises is that police look out for themselves first, society&#8217;s power brokers second, and everyone else a distant third. </p>



<p>A different narrative rebuts that cynical view: as Ethan&#8217;s cop father insists, the police stand watch at &#8220;the fine line between civilization and the unwashed.&#8221; This is the same formulation that led to the creation—in 2014, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in response to police brutality protests</a> in Ferguson, Missouri—of <a href="https://www.police1.com/police-history/articles/what-does-the-thin-blue-line-flag-mean-2J3500lyyaGueEo0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the &#8220;Thin Blue Line&#8221; flag</a>, a US flag rendered in black and white with a blue line across the middle. Some have called it authoritarian and implicitly white-supremacist because Black represents &#8220;chaos and anarchy,&#8221; while white represents &#8220;the citizenry who stand for justice and order.&#8221; You can see the flags on houses and lawns all over the United States. This film&#8217;s political framework comes from life.</p>



<p>Early in the story, Ethan tells a small group of students gathered in a high school gymnasium, &#8220;In the media and movies, we&#8217;re seen in a very specific light, often a negative light. And there are a few bad apples out there. But I&#8217;m here to tell you that most of us are good. We&#8217;re good apples.&#8221; At a time when the US Department of Justice has been weaponized against the president&#8217;s designated enemies, and ICE is invading US cities and brutalizing and kidnapping people without identifying themselves or presenting warrants, the &#8220;a few bad apples don&#8217;t spoil the barrel&#8221; defense is arguably less persuasive than ever.</p>



<p>&#8220;Night Patrol&#8221; doesn&#8217;t endorse notions of an egalitarian US in which everyone is equal under the law, presumably because viewers would find it ridiculous no matter what party they voted for. In the gymnasium scene, the student who is most visibly disbelieving and annoyed is also the only Black student. The cop&#8217;s monologue is cut short when a gymnasium door bursts in, and a Black gunman with a kerchief covering the bottom half of his face enters, blasting an Uzi at the ceiling and threatening the audience, then demands the only Black student at the assembly kneel on the hardwood floor and suggestively suck his own finger. The masked gunman is subsequently revealed as Xavier having a bit of fun. Ethan warns Xavier that pulling a stunt like that could get him kicked off the force, and that using blanks, not live ammo, wouldn&#8217;t hold much weight with investigators, even though they&#8217;re both buzzed by the students&#8217; terror at briefly becoming hostages.</p>



<p>We intuit that Xavier has to be full of self-loathing to have humiliated the only Black student in the gym. Sure enough, Xavier&#8217;s semi-estranged family are longtime Black Panther-affiliated progressive activists who made common cause with local gangs, including one (led by rapper Freddie Gibbs&#8217; stony badass Cornelius) that purports to battle lizard men, demons, Satan, and other malevolent forces. Does Xavier&#8217;s abandonment of his old life make him a &#8220;pick me&#8221; type whose obsequious identification with the LAPD makes him a traitor to his community? &#8220;What is that, the Crip version of rebelling against your parents?&#8221; teases Hawkins.</p>



<p>One of the most insightful aspects of the script (credited to Prows, Shaye Ogbonna, Tim Cairo, and Jake Gibson) is how it portrays the relationship between police and their communities. The Los Angeles citizens in this movie are treated like natives of a foreign land that&#8217;s under military occupation. The police here have no apparent connection to the people they&#8217;re supposed to serve and protect. Joining a police force, suggests &#8220;Night Patrol,&#8221; makes a person loyal mainly to other police, whether they are engaged in necessary and lawful work or violating their oath; and inclined to view criticisms as cruel, unfair attacks on their self-image as The Good Guys.</p>



<p>Sure enough, a lot of Ethan and Xavier&#8217;s bond comes from the shared dopamine hits built into big-city policing, whether they&#8217;re generated by chasing a suspect through an alley, pulling over an anonymous motorist who could be armed and dangerous; or availing themselves of the many minor privileges that accrue after joining what criminal justice reporter Jessica Pishko calls the “<a href="https://sheriffs.substack.com/p/trumps-fascist-michigan-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Law Enforcement Baronial Class</a>.” That last benefit is illustrated in a scene where Ethan and Xavier have lunch at a taco stand, and Ethan cheerfully speaks Spanish to the cook. They both receive their meals immediately, and neither party indicates that payment was ever expected.</p>



<p>Notice, too, how the violent or chaotic actions that Ethan and Xavier partake in have so little apparent impact on their psyches that they&#8217;re subsequently shown laughing at each other&#8217;s terrible jokes as if they&#8217;re just a couple of regular dudes hanging out. When they seem to experience pangs of guilt, the moment passes quickly.</p>



<p>There is a sense in which both police officers&#8217; life trajectories were locked in due to the family traumas and dysfunctions they endured as children. Ethan wants to live up to the image of his late father (Dermot Mulroney), a violent and domineering man of bulldozing moral certitude. Xavier hopes to set himself apart from his mother, who states that both he and Wazi disappointed her for different reasons, and makes it clear that what matters most to her in life is sticking it to The Man.</p>



<p>&#8220;Night Patrol&#8221; doesn&#8217;t feel as fleshed out as it should. Some of the backup performances are, let&#8217;s say, less than good. There are a few affectations that are annoying because they don&#8217;t seem organically rooted in the story, such as the pointless numbered chapter titles, a residue of the post-&#8220;Pulp Fiction&#8221; years when every other director wanted to be Quentin Tarantino. The script spends its first two-thirds jumping among parallel narrative tracks while setting up a big finish in which everything converges in a hail of bullets. But when that final stretch arrives, it may be hard to muster excitement because, skillfully staged as it is, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of large-scale action scenes with heavily armed characters battling through one location, but we haven&#8217;t seen anything quite like the mythology of the criminals and cops that&#8217;s fleshed out during the lead-up.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s still invigorating to see a horror movie that has a lot on its mind and chooses to express it in the manner of &#8217;70s-generated horror masters like George Romero, Wes Craven, and John Carpenter, who weren&#8217;t afraid to embed social critiques in tales of fantastic and terrifying creatures. Carpenter&#8217;s influence is especially palpable, thanks to Benjamin Kitten&#8217;s lusciously grainy wide-frame imagery; Pepijn Caudron&#8217;s buzzing, growling, thumping synthesized score; and Prows&#8217; willingness to slow the pace to make room for character development and atmosphere for its own sake.</p>



<p>Most impressive of all is the feeling that these humans (and vampire folk) live in a world that existed before we started watching the film that they&#8217;re in, and will continue to exist after it&#8217;s done. All the lead characters are more complex than we may have expected, including those coded as straight-up villains.</p>



<p>Even though &#8220;Night Patrol&#8221; is being marketed as escapist junk, it&#8217;s an of-the-moment political film that&#8217;s being Trojan-horsed into theaters and onto streaming platforms. It would play equally well on a double bill with Kathryn Bigelow&#8217;s 1987 vampire movie &#8220;Near Dark,&#8221; in which the bad guys are a murderous, sensuous, bloodsucking version of the Bonnie and Clyde gang, tantalizing a straight-arrow farm lad with promises of a decadent outlaw life; and &#8220;Training Day,&#8221; about a ring of crooks within the LAPD that&#8217;s essentially the Crips with tactical gear and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_immunity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualified immunity</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;Night Patrol&#8221; is far from perfect, but it&#8217;s got a certain something that pulls you in. The bleakness of its worldview is matched by the integrity of its filmmaking and performances. The life it depicts is not sugarcoated. It&#8217;s drenched in blood.</p>
